## Stuff regarding Experiencing a Headache

* that (VARIK experiences a headache, and the headache is sufficient for "desiring" vomiting),
* that (VARIK sleeps),
* that (VARIK experiences a headache, and the headache is sufficient for "desiring" vomiting),
* that (VARIK drinks saltwater), and
* that (VARIK does not experience a headache).

A part of the justification of attempting the saltwater thing is that salt is an electrolyte.

VARIK is not certain about that drinking saltwater causes decreasing in experiencing a headache.  But VARIK suspects that drinking saltwater is the cause.

* that (VARIK is glad about being agender) (which is exceeded (in being an event of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) the event of not being glad or depressed), and
* that (VARIK is glad about that a thing which is possible is increasing in being glad about being agender).
