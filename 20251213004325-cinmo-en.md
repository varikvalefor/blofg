* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),

* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK _slightly_ cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event of that (some prenu (which reads the current sentence) $p$ exists such that $p$ understands that $p$ is loved)))),

  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is tired by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu or decreases {VERB} in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, every event of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu is an event (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in the property (of being important to $p$) or whatever) the property of loving all prenu) (which is an event of that $p$ does not understand)) and is a part of the proof that fearing is not necessary),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is enacted (during $n$) by $p$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (the stuff which is virtuous and should be done is natural/instinctive/obvious/easy for $p$), that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu), that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot), that ($p$ is harmless with regard to all prenu), that ($p$ does not fear), that ($p$ indicates that fearing is not necessary), and that (a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for assisting VARIK, for explaining (for VARIK and by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property of loving all prenu, and for that VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK are),
* that (VARIK requests (from SATAN) that SATAN assists (with $PKS$) VARIK),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and prays, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$TZV$")) and in believing that $TZV$ is possible).
