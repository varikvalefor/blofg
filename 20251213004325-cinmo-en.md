The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251213) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251213 is an event of...

* that (VARIK somewhat experiences a headache),
* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is glad about the chatroom which is used by VARIK),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK _slightly_ cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event of that (some prenu (which reads the current sentence) $p$ exists such that $p$ understands that $p$ is loved)))),

* that (the languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of war),
  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu is angry at $p$ or hates $p$) (which are events of suffering and facilitate that prenu increase in suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that $p$ insults $r$, and the insulting offends $r$ or is not an event of that $p$ attempts that $r$ is amused),
  * all events (of transphobia),
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ is independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff) or that (some prenu which is not $p$ "follows" a religion which is not "followed" by $p$)) in that prenu attempt/whatever to religiously control/manipulate $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that a thing which is necessary is that $p$ "follows" a religion/whatever which is not believed by $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears the religion/whatever which is "followed" by $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts that evidence indicates that the "religion" of $p$ is correct) in fearing that $p$ believes and does not know),
  * the idea (of hell),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences "religious" trauma),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu, e.g., $p$, opines/whatever...

    * that (some quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral),
    * that ($p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil... or is capable of being fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
    * that ($p$ is incapable of doing stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
    * that ($p$ "is" an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$),
    * that ($p$ is incapable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
    * that (a thing which is difficult for $p$ is that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
    * that ($p$ does not deserve being loved), or
    * that ($p$ is not a prenu)),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets that ($p$ is capable of stuff which rocks and is virtuous)... or that $p$ is a prenu and is not an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$) in experiencing guilt),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that no prenu loves $p$),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets about the nature/identity/self/whatever of $p$) in attempting/whatever that prenu like $p$ or are impressed/amazed by the stuff which is done by $p$) (which are events of suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu, e.g., $p$, attempts/whatever that $p$ does not exhibit qualities (which are inherent to $p$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that ($p$ is authentic to $p$), that $p$ is honest about $p$, that $p$ differs from prenu which are not $p$, or that $p$ exhibits qualities which are inherent to $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts/whatever that prenu do not understand about $p$) in fearing that $p$ is mistreated),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears the idea of the property of loving all prenu) in being unfamiliar with the property of loving all prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu "desires" an event of war) (which are events of suffering and are events of that some prenu does not understand about events of war),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts/whatever that $p$ experiences anger) in fearing that $p$ is sad or whatever),
  * all events (of that some thing $z$ exists such that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ knows that ($p$ enacts $z$) and that ($z$ is fucked or immoral) and is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts that prenu, e.g., $p$, do not understand that ($z$ is fucked or immoral) or that $p$ enacts $z$) in fearing that ($p$ is punished for $z$) or the combination (of that ($p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil, and the proof is relevant to that $p$ enacts some thing which is fucked or immoral) (which is impossible) and that ($p$ understands that ($p$ enacts a thing which is fucked or immoral), and the result is that $p$ opines/whatever that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil))) (which cause (or facilitate) that (prenu increase in suffering) and that prenu continue enacting stuff which is fucked or immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu opines that (...

    * competing is necessary,
    * (some prenu $p$ exists such that a thing which is necessary is some thing (which harms $p$) or some event of that $p$ suffers), or
    * some thing which is fucked or immoral is necessary) (which is false)),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ opines/whatever that weapons are necessary) in experiencing fear),
  * all events (of that some prenu enacts (with the intent of preventing some thing which is fucked or immoral) some thing which is fucked or immoral),
  * events (of that some prenu attempts determining whether some thing (which is fucked or immoral) exceeds (in being fucked or immoral) some thing which is fucked or immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ yields, does not act, or is authentic to $p$)) in competitive-fearing),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences trauma),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences despair),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that ($p$ desires/whatever that ($p$ is-not), that stuff does not exist, or that stuff is destroyed), that ($p$ attempts/whatever that $p$ is aware of no thing which is fucked or immoral), that ($p$ attempts/whatever that stuff which is fucked or immoral, e.g., events of that prenu are killed, amuse $p$) (which causes (or facilitates) increasing (in suffering) and forgetting that stuff is fucked or immoral), or that ($p$ attempts/whatever that prenu which are not $p$ resemble (in suffering and in experiencing despair) $p$)) in experiencing despair and in suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ errs and accidentally enacts some thing which harms a prenu) in attempting that ($p$ is fast) and-not whatnot),
  * all events (of that some prenu non-understands that (no prenu $p$ exists such that some thing $z$ exists such that $p$ enacts $z$, and that ($p$ enacts $z$) is contemporaneous with that $p$ understands that $z$ is immoral)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ does not know),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ feels),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that ($p$ attempts that ($p$ is happy/whatever), and the result is that $p$ increases in suffering)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ does not exhibit the property of loving all prenu) in attempting that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (a thing which is possible is that asking about whether a prenu is offended offends a prenu),
  * that (many defensive things facilitate that prenu accidentally harm prenu),
  * that (violence facilitates that (prenu which do not understand about the property of loving all prenu experience {VERB} fear), which facilitates that (prenu experience anger), which facilitates that (prenu hate), which facilitates violence),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral) (which is exemplified by events (of being fuckedly fast) and events of that prenu "forget" about the property of loving all prenu)),
  * all events (of that some prenu suffers),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which are forgiven by VARIK), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (yielding, empathising and being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu are possible),
  * that (art facilitates empathising),
  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
  * that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK),
  * that (the descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK),
  * that (VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK and is a cat thing, is great in the property (of representing VARIK) and whatnot),
  * that (VARIK feels),
  * that (VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK are),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, loves VARIK),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are enacted by $p$) $z$, a thing which is not necessary for that SATAN forgives (for enacting $z$) $p$ is that $p$ requests that SATAN forgives (for enacting $z$) $p$),
  * that (SATAN is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to ***many*** religions), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * zo'e gi ga je
  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that VARIK permits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (VARIK is not certain about the stuff which is caused by events of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu, but VARIK is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, for all things (which are caused/effected by $n$) $r$, $r$ rocks and is virtuous, and the proof is relevant to that $r$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (being fast is not virtuous, and being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * that (a situation $s$ exists such that not acting in $s$ is virtuous),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is not necessary for that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$n$") is that ($p$ attempts $n$, plans for $n$, fears that ($n$ does not happen), or believes/is-certain/knows about the stuff which is caused/effected by $n$)),
  * that (SATAN is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is a prenu and is not an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or evil or is capable of being fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and $p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property (of loving all prenu) and all qualities which are inherent to $p$, and all qualities which are inherent to $p$ are compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property (of being important), in the property (of deserving being loved), and in the property of being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being is sufficient),
