The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250925) and Whatnot
===========================================================================
Some part of 20250925 is an event of...

* that (VARIK experiences a headache and experiences pain "in" the left ear),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender) and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK irons the agender flag which is owned by VARIK),
* that (VARIK thanks prenu which use (as a pronoun of VARIK) "IT" or a variable),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is mild in experiencing gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK feels that (prenu attempt that (VARIK is male), which is impossible)... and is glad about that (the thing is impossible)),
* that (VARIK attempts definining `spavineia`, which is a cryptography thing, and uses (for defining `spavineia`) Agda),
* that (VARIK is slightly annoyed by a kernel panic event),
* that (VARIK is slightly curious about the cause of the kernel panic event),
* that (VARIK is not certain about whether using (for "move") (metaphor-(quote-marks))/"pe'a" is "necessary"),
* that (VARIK is not angry at prenu which are not VARIK),
* that (VARIK is not certain about whether VARIK is angry at prenu),
* that (VARIK expects that VARIK is killed or whatever because VARIK is transgender),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends to protect and assist all prenu),
* that (VARIK experiences stress about stuff which is fucked and immoral),
* that (VARIK is glad about experiencing stress about stuff which is fucked and immoral),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires that (VARIK discovers the stuff (which can be done by VARIK, is virtuous, is anti-violent, facilitates stuff which is virtuous, and prevents stuff which is immoral), a.k.a. "$KL$"), that (VARIK causes examples of $KL$), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK feels that VARIK is inadequate/insufficient in doing stuff which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK loves all prenu),
* that (VARIK loves all prenu, and loving is sufficient for that (VARIK cries)),
* that (that (VARIK loves all prenu) is not sufficient for that (VARIK cries))),
* that (VARIK intends to be perfect/maximal in loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about that (some prenu desire that that (prenu which lack houses die)), all events (of believing (or whatever) that prenu are not prenu), that (many prenu desire that (prenu are not forgiven) or desire punishing and-not lovingly explaining), that (many prenu desire (or whatever) being amused by stuff which is fucked, e.g., suicides (which are unintentional) and suffering), that (events (of being angry at prenu) and events of hating prenu are easy and are fucked and immoral), the events (of that VARIK mistreats prenu) (which include angrily insulting), that (prenu claim that (things which are fucked are jokes), and prenu do not attend to prenu (which are offended) and do not admit that the joke or whatever is fucked), that (violent metaphors are common/frequent), that (prenu accept/whatever that (that (a prenu suffers) is the "price" of that (many prenu do not suffer)), which is incompatible with loving all prenu), that (fearing change, e.g., increasing in properties which are virtuous, is easy), that (observing many things which are fucked and immoral facilitates forgetting that for all prenu $p$, $p$ is capable of doing stuff which is virtuous), that (for some prenu $p$, eaqsy for $p$ is forgetting (or whatever {VERB}) that prenu which do not resemble $p$ are prenu), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about that (lovingly communicating, which is empathetically communicating, is an example of $KL$) and that (VARIK understands or knows that loving all prenu is virtuous), that (VARIK succeeds in becoming a vegan), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear-or-whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about that (no prenu is evil), that (all prenu are capable of stuff which is virtuous), that (considering the property of loving all prenu facilitates stuff which is virtuous and anti-facilitates stuff which is immoral), that (VARIK understands or knows that loving all prenu is virtuous), that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu causes that (virtuous stuff is natural/instinctive/obvious)), that (no quality which is immoral is inherent to a prenu), that (a thing which is impossible is "changing" the past, but that (learning is attempted) and attempting that stuff which sucks is not repeated are possible), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK requests (via the part of the current sentence) that SATAN assists with that (VARIK increases (in all qualities which are virtuous) and decreases in all qualities which are immoral)), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) but is very extreme in expecting stuff which is very extreme in being virtuous and in rocking).

## Experiencing Pain
20250925 is the date of that (that (a part of the left ear is "moved") causes that (VARIK experiences pain in the left ear)).

Additionally, 20250925 is the date of that (VARIK suspects that VARIK experiences a headache).  But a thing which is possible is that VARIK mistakes (for experiencing a headache) experiencing pain in the ear.

## That No Thing which is Immoral is Inherent to a Prenu
VARIK believes that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is fucked and immoral is inherent to $p$), a.k.a. "$k$".

VARIK experiences spiritual hope about $k$, which is a part of a proof of that (for all qualities (which are fucked and immoral) $s$, for all prenu $p$, if $p$ is not maximal in not exhibiting $s$, then a thing which is possible is that $p$ decreases in $p$).
