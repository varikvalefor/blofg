# The Stuff which is Small
Frequent is that a prenu $t$ opines $K$, which is that (necessary is that $t$ causes a thing (which is good but small) xor a thing which is good and large.

But $K$ is false.  That ("AND" is appropriate) is possible.

But attempting that (stuff is fast) and whatnot does not facilitate discovering that $K$ is false.  But false is that being fast is inherently virtuous.  Important is the nature of the thing which is done quickly.
