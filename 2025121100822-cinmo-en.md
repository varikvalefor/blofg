The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251211) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad events (of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),

* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries and slightly struggles with speaking) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous))),

* that (the languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of war),
  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu is angry at $p$ or hates $p$) (which are events of suffering, facilitate that prenu increase in suffering, and are events of that prenu do not understand),

  * the idea (of hell),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences religious trauma),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets about the nature/identity/self/whatever of $p$) in attempting/whatever that prenu like $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu, e.g., $p$, attempts/whatever that $p$ does not exhibit qualities (which are inherent to $p$), e.g., the gender identity of $p$),

  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (VARIK is not certain about the stuff which is caused by events of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu, but VARIK is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, for all things (which are caused/effected by $n$) $r$, $r$ rocks and is virtuous, and the proof is relevant to that $r$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
