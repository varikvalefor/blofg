## That (VARIK Experiences a Headache)
20251017 is the date of the event of that VARIK experiences a headache and is slightly tired.  20251016 does not resemble.

VARIK is not certain about the cause of experiencing a headache.

## That (VARIK Welcomes Loving VARIK)
Many events (of that VARIK welcomes (and does-not-resist) that VARIK is loved) preceede/cause/whatever events of that VARIK increases in the property of loving all prenu.

The thing does not surprise VARIK.  Welcoming-and-not-resisting is an event of that (VARIK yields and does not exhibit defensiveness or aggressiveness), and VARIK exhibits the property (of loving all prenu) only if VARIK loves VARIK.

## The Mosquito
A sequence of events which happen is the sequence of...

* that (VARIK observes that a mosquito, a.k.a. "$M$", inhabits the room which is inhabited by the body of VARIK),
* that ($M$ walks on the keyboard which is used by VARIK),
* that (VARIK stops typing and waits (for that $M$ leaves) (before continuing typing)),
* that ($M$ walks on the sleeve which is worn by VARIK),
* that (VARIK attempts that VARIK does not cause body movement which harms $M$),
* that (VARIK is not certain about the location of $M$),
* that (VARIK hopes that VARIK does not kill $M$),
* that ($M$ resides on the hand of VARIK),
* that (VARIK permits that $M$ drinks the blood of the hand of VARIK), and
* that ($M$ leaves, and VARIK not certain about the location of $M$).

VARIK empathises (in that the process of drinking is dangerous for $M$) with $M$.

VARIK hopes that VARIK does not kill $M$.  $M$ differs from the body of VARIK, but VARIK assumes that $M$ is the body of a prenu.
