The Emotions (which are Experienced (during 20250814) by VARIK) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is somewhat annoyed (but amused) by that (VARIK is (during situations which are appropriate for sleeping) un-tired)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about that (VARIK is amused by an insulting response to a thing which is stated by GAVIN NEWSOM and is disliked by VARIK)),
* that (VARIK attempts to remind (or whatever) about that violence does not prevent violence),
* that (VARIK does not very experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK fears (or whatever {VERB}) that (VARIK decreases in stuff (which is vrtuous) or decreases in stuff which is immoral), a.k.a. "$f$", very attempts preventing $f$, and very hopes that $f$ does not happen),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN facilitates that VARIK increases (in stuff which is virtuous, e.g., non-angrily and empathetically explaining (for prenu which cause stuff which is immoral) that stuff is immoral and not necessary) and decreases in stuff which is immoral, e.g., being angry at prenu), and
* that VARIK does not expect but very hopes for stuff which rocks and is virtuous.

## The Statement regarding GAVIN NEWSOM
"$s$" denotes a specific statement which is written by GAVIN NEWSOM.

"$r$" denotes a specific response to $s$.

A sequence of events which happens is...

* that (VARIK reads $s$, which is such that GAVIN NEWSOM attempts that $s$ resembes the stuff which is written by DONALD TRUMP),
* that (VARIK becomes a thing which dislikes $s$, and the justification of disliking is that VARIK opines that $s$ is immoral),
* that (VARIK reads $r$, which is an insult and indicates that the prenu which states $r$ believes that (GAVIN NEWSOM is unintelligent) and is liked by no prenu which is not "in" US-CA),
* that (VARIK becomes a thing which is slightly amused by $r$),
* that (VARIK realises that ($r$ is immoral) and that (being amused by $r$ and forgetting that $r$ is immoral is immoral)), and
* that VARIK becomes a thing (which is not amused by $r$), a thing which experiences spiritual pain about that (some time $t$ exists such that $t$ is the time of that VARIK is amused by $r$), and a thing which is glad about that ($r$ facilitates discovering flaws of VARIK).

Insulting a prenu (which insults a prenu which insults) is an event of insulting.

Being amused by stuff which is immoral is easy.  But being amused by stuff which is immoral facilitates forgetting that stuff is immoral.
