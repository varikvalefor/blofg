=======================================================================================

Some part of 20251010 or 20251011 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is very glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK knows that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) and that (VARIK knows that VARIK is transgender)),
* that (VARIK slightly/mildly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed (or whatever), and that (VARIK is transgender) is relevant to the justification)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK somewhat "struggles" with yielding),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for crying) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK very cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK feels defensively) (which is that VARIK is excessive in feeling defensively),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering/whatever of $p$) (which is not pleasant but facilitates protecting and assisting all prenu and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu), and
  * that (all events (of that VARIK is awake or whatever) which follow [THING] are events of that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu))),

* that (language stuff is insufficient for describing the extent of that VARIK desires that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (no prenu is evil),
  * that (all prenu deserve being loved, and earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (some jokes facilitate stuff which is virtuous),
  * that (not communicating jokes is harmless and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that loving all prenu is superlative in the quality (of being virtuous) (which is the property of being compatible with the property of loving all prenu)), and
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is a part of the proof of that choosing between the quality (of loving all prenu) and the stuff which is suggested by SATAN is unnecessary)),

* that (VARIK slightly experiences spiritual confusion about that (VARIK is not certain about whether that (grokking correct mathematics is virtuous) is an axiom or a postulate)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual confusion about whether the joke which is communicated by VARIK is-compatible-with/"fits" the property of loving all prenu)
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual discovery about that (VARIK discovers that the joke which is communicated by VARIK is not in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of despair),
  * the event (of that VARIK communicates a joke which is not in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (competitive society facilitates opining-or-whatever that (loving all prenu is impossible), that (violence is necessary), and whatnot),
  * all events (of hating prenu) (which include events of that (a prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ hates $p$)),
  * all events (of opining-or-whatever that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is the set of choices of $p$), which is a type error thing and is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * all events (of that the property of loving all prenu is not familiar to VARIK),
  * all events (of that VARIK is angry/whatever at some prenu),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (many jokes facilitate stuff which is immoral),
  * that (yielding is "difficult" for many prenu which are familiar with competing and-not whatnot),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu frightens many prenu which are not familiar with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (many prenu seem (to VARIK) to be very unfamiliar with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (observing hating, competing, and-not whatnot anti-facilitates remembering about the property of loving all prenu), and
  * that (forgiving is difficult for prenu which are not familiar with the property of loving all prenu)),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality (which is immoral), e.g., feeling defensively or feeling aggressively) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (no prenu is evil),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the cure),
  * that (events (of being angry), events (of being annoyed), events (of lying), events (of competing), events (of hating), and whatnot are unnecessary),
  * that (improving and learning from mistakes is possible)
  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (being patient "fits" the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all immoral things $z$, an event (of that $p$ enacts $z$) is an event of that $p$ does not understand that $z$ is immoral),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is awake or whatever and is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) are opportunities for that ($p$ increases/improves) and that ($p$ stops a thing which is fucked and immoral)),
  * that (jungle music facilitates yielding),
  * that (for all events (of violence) $v$, $v$ is "justified"/"caused" by fear, suffering, or whatever),
  * that (yielding facilitates increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, _no_ quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral),
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, are capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is enacted (by $p$) during $z$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (stuff which is virtuous and should be done is obvious/"instinctive"/easy for $p$)),
  * that (all stuff which is caused by being perfect in the property of loving all prenu is virtuous),
  * that (loving all prenu is extremely gentle),
  * that (loving all prenu is gentle, and the gentleness is sufficient for that (prenu are not scared)), and
  * that (loving all prenu facilitates forgiving) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that $p$ is loved) facilitates that ($p$ forgives $p$), which facilitates that ($p$ increases (in qualities which are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu) and decreases in suffering))),

* that (VARIK requests that SATAN asssists with that (all events (of that VARIK is awake or whatever) which follow [THING] are events of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is incompatible with all qualities (which are immoral), e.g., the property (of being angry at prenu), the property (of feeling defensively), and the property of feeling aggressively)),
* that (VARIK prays, and the prayer is grammatical with regard to Lojban),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays), or
* that (VARIK vaguely expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) (which includes nuclear war) but is extremely extreme in hoping for stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous).

## Jokes
Some thing $x$ exists such that being amused by $x$ facilitates stuff which rocks and is virtuous.  Some jokes facilitate empathising or whatever.

Many things $x$ exist such that being amused by $x$ facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral.  Many jokes anti-facilitate empathising or whatever or facilitate that (some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu $s$ exists such that (that ($s$ suffers) amuses $p$, and $p$ is not serious about that $s$ suffers)).

Communicating jokes which are harmless is virtuous (or whatever) with regard to the religion of VARIK.

But communicating jokes which are harmful is immoral.  Communicating jokes which are harmful is incompatible with loving all prenu, and for all $x$, if $x$ is incompatible with loving all prenu, then $x$ is immoral.

That (a prenu does not communicate jokes, is honest, and exhibits the property of loving all prenu) is harmless and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu.

VARIK experiences spiritual joy about that (attempting communicating jokes is not necessary) and that (some jokes are virtuous).
