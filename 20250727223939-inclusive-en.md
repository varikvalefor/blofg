Being Inclusive
===============

Many chatrooms $t$ exist such that (the operator (of $t$) and the users of $t$ state that $t$ is an inclusive thing, but the operator of $t$ insults or bans VARIK because VARIK is weird).

The thing is fucked by the standard of VARIK; things which are immoral include xenophobia and mistreating.  Additionally, fucked is falsely stating that prenu which are weird are tolerated.

Banning VARIK annoys VARIK.  But VARIK empathises and resembles; a thing $t$ and a time $c$ exist such that $c$ is contemporaneous with that (VARIK fears $t$ because $t$ is weird to VARIK).
