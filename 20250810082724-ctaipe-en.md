Using (for Explaining Things) Proofs
====================================

VARIK very likes...

* that (proofs facilitate explaining for prenu which do not trust),
* that (proofs are appropriate for things (which are simple) and things which are very complex),
* that (proofs facilitate discovering flaws in opinions/conclusions and whatnot),
* that (necessary (or whatever) for defining proofs which are good are thinking and asking questions which are good), and
* that (a thing which is easy is that (definitions of proofs are "increased" in being indicative), i.e., that parts of proofs "replace" postulates and whatnot).

The liking is relevant to the proof of that many explanations which are created by VARIK are proof things.
