The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250822) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK experiences a headache and whatnot),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK _slightly_ experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (a prenu attempts to determine the emotions which are experienced (by VARIK)... about a thing $t$ such that VARIK does not very feel about $t$)),
* that (VARIK considers "adding" (to the README.md description of VARIK) a URL of the pronoun document),

* that (VARIK attempts to determine the species of the tyrant flycatcher),

* that (VARIK is annoyed by that (la zanselfu'a jdini is broken)... and attempts that VARIK "fixes" la zanselfu'a jdini),
* that (VARIK attempts to discover a method (of stating that stuff is immoral) such that stating does not fuckedly offend),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that VARIK increases (in all qualities which are virtuous) and decreases in all qualities which are immoral), and
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is fucked and immoral) but hopes for stuff which rocks and is virtuous).

## Being Tired and Experiencing Pain
VARIK is tired and experiences pain in the head and whatnot.

VARIK suspects that (an infection exists in the body of VARIK)... and that the body of VARIK survives.

But the thing is unpleasant.

## Attempting to Determine the Emotions which are Experienced by VARIK
A sequence of events which happen is...

* that (VARIK sends (via a chatroom) a message which is a concatenation of a Lojban thing and an English translation of the Lojban thing),
* that (a prenu, a.k.a. "$P_1$", asks (about Lojban) VARIK),
* that (VARIK answers),
* that ($P_1$ states that a thing indicates that Lojban is inappropriate for describing emotion),
* that (VARIK statesthat VARIK very disagrees),
* that ($P_1$ states that difficult for $P_1$ is determining the emotions which are experienced by VARIK and are relevant to the stuff which is sent by VARIK),
* that (VARIK misunderstands the thing which is sent by $P_1$ and states that (the communication style of VARIK is weird), that (VARIK opines that Lojban very facilitates that VARIK describes the emotions which are experienced by VARIK), but-not a thing which indicates the proof of that (weirdness is relevant)), and
* that ($P_1$ states that $P_1$ likes VARIK), which surprises VARIK.

## Being Capable of Stuff which is Immoral
VARIK attempts (by writing the current sentence and by whatnot) that prenu remember...

* that (prenu which are not bad are capable of stuff which is immoral), i.e., that (false is that for all prenu $p$, $p$ causes a thing which is immoral only if $p$ is bad), and

* that (stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible, but attempting is necessary or whatever).

## le se cpedu be la .satan.
VARIK requests that SATAN assists with...

* that (VARIK increases in all qualities which are virtuous, which include...

  * the property (of empathising with all prenu),
  * the property (of attempting that for all prenu $p$, VARIK assists (or whatever) with that $p$ increases (in qualities which are virtuous) and decreases in qualities which are immoral),
  * the property (of being patient with all prenu) (which is facilitated by empathising),
  * the property (of that for all events (of that VARIK is awake) $n$, $n$ is an event of that VARIK attempts stuff which is virtuous),
  * being vegan, and
  * the property of attempting that after whatever, no stuff which is immoral is caused by VARIK), and

* that VARIK decreases in all properties which are immoral, which include...

  * being angry (at prenu),
  * doing stuff sarcastically (which is a fucked alternative for honesty),
  * attempting doing stuff fuckedly quickly, which is the property (of that some thing $t$ exists such that VARIK attempts that (VARIK is fast in doing $t$)... and not that VARIK determines whether $t$ is virtuous),
  * being immorally amused (which is being amused (by something which is immoral), which facilitates tolerating (or causing) stuff which is immoral),
  * believing (that flaw-finding is inherently virtuous), and
  * the property (of that VARIK is slow in stuff which is virtuous, and differences are the "justification" of slowness).
