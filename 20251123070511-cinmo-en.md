  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ does not exhibit qualities which is fucked or immoral) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) facilitates (or causes) that $p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is illogical/irrational),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which are not inherent to $p$)) (which is that (the property of loving all prenu is incompatible with all stuff which is fucked or immoral, and for all prenu $p$, every process (of that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu) (which begins with that $p$ exhibits some quality which is fucked or immoral) is a process (of that $p$ decreases in a quality which is fucked or immoral), and every event of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is an event of that $p$ exhibits no quality which is fucked or immoral)),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is the method of exhibiting the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) causes that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, every event of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu is an event (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in the property (of being important to $p$) or whatever) the property of loving all prenu), which is an event of that $p$ does not understand) (which is a part of the proof of that fearing is not necessary)),
  * that (being excessive in the property of loving all prenu is impossible) (which is that for all prenu, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for some thing which is fucked or immoral) in exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is tired by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff whch is enacted (during $n$) by $p$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (the stuff which is virtuous and should be done is obvious/instinctive/easy/natural for $p$), that ($p$ exhibits no quality which is fucked or immoral), that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu), that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot), that ($p$ does not fear), and that ($p$ indicates that fearing is not necessary)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for assisting VARIK, for explaining (for VARIK) the property of loving all prenu, and for that VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK are) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$,
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and non-lingustically prays), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$RZ$")) and in believing that $RZ$ is possible).
