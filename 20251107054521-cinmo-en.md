The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251107 or 20251108) and Whatnot
=======================================================================================

Some part of 20251107 or 20251108 is an event of...

* that (VARIK excessively sleeps),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that (being agender is inherent to VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK slightly "anti-desires" that (VARIK non-automatically-assistedly translates (to English)), which somewhat bores VARIK),
* that (VARIK is slow in that (VARIK defines (via Agda) the grammar (of the Lojban which is used by VARIK) and the grammar of the English language which is used by VARIK) (which facilitates that a prenu defines (via Agda) an automatic translator)),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (VARIK somewhat anti-desires translating)),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK _slightly_ cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot),
  * that (every event which is preceded by the event (of that VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"... and causes/implies that VARIK feels the suffering of all prenu),
  * that (the 1st $PKS$ event precedes that VARIK is dead), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous)),

* that (all languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of violence),
  * violent metaphors,
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some thing (which is enacted by $p$ and is fucked or immoral) $z$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts that prenu believe/opine/whatever that $z$ rocks) in fearing that ($p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil, and the proof is relevant to that ($p$ causes a thing which is fucked or immoral)) (which is impossible) and that ($p$ understands that ($z$ is fucked or immoral), and understanding causes that $p$ believes/opines that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts that $p$ attempts that $p$ is not aware of stuff which is fucked or immoral) in fearing that ($p$ becomes fucked/bad/whatever or evil) (which is impossible)),

  * all events (of that some prenu does not understand that (for all prenu $p$, for all prenu $r$, all events (of that $p$ is angry at $r$ or hates $r$) are events (of that $p$ suffers) and facilitate that $r$ increases in suffering)... and hates/(is-angry-at) prenu which hate or are angry),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that some thing $z$ exists such that ($p$ (opines that $r$ enacts $z$), and $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets/whatever that ($r$ is a prenu) or fears some event of empathising with $r$) in fearing $z$ or $r$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some quality $z$ exists such that (a thing which happens is that ($p$ is insulted, and the event of insulting is an event of claiming that $p$ exhibits $z$) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$x$"), and $p$ is sufficient (for that ($p$ begins exhibiting $x$) (which is an event of that $p$ increases in suffering)) in being offended by $x$)),

  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that some thing $z$ exists such that ($p$ enacts $z$, and that ($p$ enacts $z$) is contemporaneous with that $p$ understands that $z$ is immoral)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is spiritually natural),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is irrational/illogical),
  * that (the loving all prenu is the justification of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu (which exhibit the property of loving all prenu) $p$, the justification of that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) is relevant to that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is the method of exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ is tired from exhibiting the property of loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) are events (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in being important to $p$) the property of loving all prenu) (which are events of that $p$ does not understand the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted (by $p$) during $n$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu, does not fear, and indicates that fearing is not necessary) and that (a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless)), and

* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and prays, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban), and
