# WebP
VARIK uses (for converting (into WebP files) PNG sequences) `img2webp(1)`.  The WebP files are great.

JPEG XL exceeds (in being liked by VARIK... but in excessively using (for decompression) RAM) WebP.


But VARIK is not certain of a method (of converting (into PNG sequences) WebP files) which is great and generates the PNG files which are used for creating the WebP file.  `convert foo.webp foo.png` does frame difference images, and `convert foo.webp foo.apng` excessively uses RAM.

A thing which is likely is that if VARIK discovers, then VARIK "updates".
