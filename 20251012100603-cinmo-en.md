The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251012) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251012 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is excessively tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender) and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) and that (VARIK knows that VARIK is transgender)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender))),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and asssits all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for crying) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for slightly crying) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK feels defensively or feels aggressively) (which is that VARIK is excessive in feeling defensively or in feeling aggressively),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering which is experienced by $p$) (which is not pleasant but is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate that prenu which are not VARIK understand that experiencing emotion is not a flaw),
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous), and
  * that (all events which are preceded by [THING] are events of that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu))),

* that (language stuff is insufficient for describing the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * that (for many prenu $p$, that ($p$ does not believe, and $p$ does not observe that a prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) facilitates that $p$ opines that loving all prenu is impossible),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is unfamiliar to many prenu),
  * that (for many prenu $p$, that ($p$ yields) is easy-difficult for $p$, and that ($p$ is familiar with competitive society, whatnot, and-not whatnot) anti-facilitates yielding)
  * that (competitive societies, e.g., capitalist stuff, facilitate forgetting about the property of loving all prenu), and
  * that (being angry, hating, being annoyed, and whatnot are easy for prenu which are familiar with competitive society, war, whatnot, and-not whatnot)),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (many films regarding stuff which is fucked faciliate stuff (which is virtuous), e.g., empathising with prenu which enact stuff which is fucked) and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual hope about...

  * that (VARIK believes),
  * that (improving is possible),
  * that (no prenu is evil),
  * that (all things which are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu are virtuous),
  * that (for many prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes that a prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) facilitates that $p$ remembers that loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $c$, all things which are enacted (by $p$) during $c$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (that (VARIK welcomes loving VARIK) facilitates that VARIK increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the "cure"),
  * that (all events (of violence) and whatnot are "justified"/"caused" by suffering, fearing, not understanding that the thing is not necessary, or whatever),
  * that (yielding facilitates (or causes) increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (competitive society does not cause that (remembering about the property of loving all prenu is impossible)),
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, are capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (competitive society is the aggregate of stuff which is enacted by many prenu, which are capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for facilitating that VARIK understands (or believes) that loving all prenu is superlatively virtuous) SATAN),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK prays, and the prayer is grammatical with regard to Lojban),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (all events which are preceded by [THING] are events of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) and that the property of loving all prenu replaces (in being exhibited by VARIK) all properties which are immoral), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) but is extremely extreme in hoping for stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous).
