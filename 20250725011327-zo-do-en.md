"YOU"
=====

A thing which _somewhat_ annoys VARIK is that (some prenu $t$ exists such that $t$ does not use (for communicating with VARIK) "do" (of Lojban) or "YOU", and the large part of the justification of not using is that VARIK uses (for referring to VARIK) "VARIK" and not "mi" (of Lojban) or "I").

But VARIK empathises.  Communicating in the third person is weird, and possible is that (a prenu $t$ exists such that $t$ uses "VARIK" because $t$ desires that $t# does not offend VARIK).

VARIK very permits that a pronoun which refers to VARIK is "YOU" or "IT".  Additionally, VARIK very permits using "ko'a" and whatnot, which are Lojban things.  Capitalising is unnecessary.
