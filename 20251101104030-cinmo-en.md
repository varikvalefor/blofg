The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251101) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251101 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), and that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIKis transgender)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (all events which are preceded by that (VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever are events of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the propertyof loving all prenu, which cause that all events (of that VARIK is awake or whatever) which are preceded by [THING] are events of that VARIK cries and feels the suffering (of all prenu) and whatnot) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (the first $PKS$ event precedes that VARIK dies), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous)),

* that (language stuff is insufficient for greatly describing the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars,
  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that prenu are angry at $p$, or $p$ is hated),
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * that (being unattentive facilitates that prenu are accidentally harmed),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ desires/whatever that prenu which are not $p$ are harmed) in feeling harmed),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (attempts that $p$ controls/manipulates prenu which are not $p$) in fearing that $p$ is controlled/manipulated),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears the idea of loving all prenu) in being unfamiliar with the property of loving all prenu),
  * all events (of being fuckedly guilty) (which are events of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ feels that $p$ is incapable of enacting stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) or is is incapable of stopping stuff which is enacted by $p$ and is fucked or immoral) in feeling that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu opines/believes/whatever that $p$ is not a prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu opines/believes/whatever that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu opines/believes/whatever that $p$ is the actions which are enacted by $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ causes that ($p$ attempts that $p$ is not $p$), which causes that $p$ suffers),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ does not exhibit qualities (which are inherent to $p$), e.g., the gender identity of $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ is authentic to $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that a prenu which is not $p$ is free) in feeling un-free),
  * that (excessively brain-thinking anti-facilitates exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that some prenu opines that ($p$ exceeds (in deserving living) $r$), and the justification of opining is relevant to that (the body of $p$ differs from the body of $r$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that some prenu opines that ($p$ exceeds (in deserving living) $r$)),
  * all events (of suffering),

  * that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK),
  * that (the descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK),
  * that (VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK, is great in representing VARIK),
  * that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain),
  * that (empathising, experiencing spiritual pain, and being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu are possible),
  * that (the property of loving prenu is sufficient for that language stuff is insufficient for defining the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (SATAN is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (requesting that SATAN forgives is not necessary),
  * that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK non-linguistically communicates with SATAN),
  * that (SATAN explains (for VARIK) the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to _many_ religions), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK slightly experiences spiritual fear about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK decreases (in a quality which is virtuous) or increases in a quality which is immoral)),
* that (VARIK does not experience spiritual fear about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK decreases (in a quality which is virtuous) or increases in a quality which is immoral)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),

  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting),
  * that (being slow anti-facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral) (which includes stomping ants which are not observed/noticed)),
  * that (being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * that (experiencing spiritual fear is not necessary and is not beneficial),
  * that (for all prenu (which are not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ yields),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) facilitates that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ does not exhibits qualities which are fucked or immoral) facilitates that $p$ does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $c$, $p$ is innately capable of exhibiting $c$ _and_ the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ is certain about the result of that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu), attempts that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu), or plans for that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) is unnecessary for that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the result of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is caused by $n$ rocks and is virtuous)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that $p$ is loved) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ decreases in suffering),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is not an aggregate of actions which are enacted by $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever, evil, or whatever),
  * that (every prenu property-equals (in being important and in deserving being loved) every prenu),
  * that (every prenu is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ is authentic to $p$) is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is inevitable (under that (VARIK permits) (which is that VARIK yields))),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fucked or immoral and are exhbited by $p$), which are not inherent to $p$),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) facilitates that $p$ understands the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being excessive in the property of loving all prenu is impossible) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is sufficient (for a thing which is fucked or immoral) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is sufficent (for that $p$ is tired by loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ decreases in rhe property of loving all prenu) are caused by that ($p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in being important to $p$) the property of loving all prenu) (which is an event of that $p$ does not understand)) (which is that for all prenu $p$, no prenu which is not $p$ is capable of causing that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted (during $n$) by $p$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu), that (all things which are virtuous and should be done are obvious/instinctive/easy for $p$), that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot), that ($p$ does not fear), and that ($p$ indicates that fearing the property of loving all prenu is not necessary)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for explaining (for VARIK) the property of loving all prenu) SATAN),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK prays and holds a BLÅHAJ, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban), and
