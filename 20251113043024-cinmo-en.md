  * that (VARIK does not control the future, and VARIK is uncertain about the future),
  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (art facilitates empathising) (which is that for all prenu $p_1$, for all prenu $p_2$, for all art pieces (which are created by $p_1$) $z$, that ($p_2$ understands about $z$) causes (or facilitates) that $p_2$ empathises with $p_1$),
  * that (attempting, planning, and fearing are not necessary for being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ attempts that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), plans (for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), or fears that $p$ is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is not necessary for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is a flaw, is fucked, or is immoral, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $k$, $p$ is innately capable of exhibiting the combination of $k$ and the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is inherent to all prenu, e.g., VARIK),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is authentic to $p$) are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in being important and in deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (every prenu property-equals (in being important and in deserving being loved) every prenu),
  * that (a thing which is impossible is that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ decreases in being important or in deserving being loved),
  * that (a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ decreases in being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)) (which is that for all prenu $p$, no event, e.g., stuff which is enacted by $p$, causes that $p$ decreases in being capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no thing which is fucked or immoral is necessary),
  * that (being slow, which is facilitated by being attentive to all prenu, anti-facilitates stuff which is fucked or immoral),
  * that (yielding causes (or facilitates) increasing in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for every prenu (which is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu causes yielding),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral) causes (or facilitates) that $p$does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualties (which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which are not inherent to $p$)),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is irrational/illogical),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are caused by $n$ rock and are virtuous)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ knows/believes about the stuff which is caused by events of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is not necessary for that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exibits the property of loving all prenu) is the method of that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are enacted by $p$) $z$, events (of that $p$ is forgiven for enacting $z$) exceed (in facilitating that $p$ understands that ($p$ is not fucked/bad/whatever or evil), loves $p$, decreases in suffering, forgives $p$, enacts stuff which rocks and is virtuous, and stops stuff which is fucked or immoral) events of forgetting that $p$ enacts $z$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that $p$ is loved) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ decreases in suffering),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all things $x$, $x$ is virtuous if-and-only-if $x$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (no prenu is "perfect"/maximal in forgetting about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is tired by loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu is excessive in the property of loving all prenu)) (which is that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is "sufficient" (for some thing which is fucked or immoral) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) are events (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in the property (of being important to $p$) or whatever) the property of loving all prenu) (which are events of that $p$ does not understand about the property of loving all prenu)) (which is a part of the proof of that fearing prenu and fearing decreasing in the property of loving all prenu are unnecessary)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted (by $p$) during $n$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (all stuff which should be done and is virtuous is obvious/instinctive/natural/easy for $p$), that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot), that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu, does not fear, and indicates that fearing is not necessary)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for that (SATAN assists VARIK and explains (for VARIK and by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property of loving all prenu)... and that (VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK exist)) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and prays, and the prayer is grammatical with regard to Lojban), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) or whatever and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$MM$")) and in believing that $MM$ is possible).
