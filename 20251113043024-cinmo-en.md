The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251113) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251113 is an event of...

* that (VARIK non-excessively sleeps),
* that (VARIK does not dream),
* that (VARIK does not experience surprise about that (VARIK does not dream)),
* that (VARIK is extremely glad about thaty (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that (being agender is inherent to VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),

* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot),
  * that (every event which is preceded by the event (of that VARIK writes/communicates the current sentence) is an event of that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"... and causes that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot)), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that some prenu (which reads the Blofg posts) $p$ exists such that $p$ understands that $p$ is loved)),

  * that (evidence is not necessary for believing),
  * that (being fast is not virtuous),
  * that (being busy/active is not virtuous),
  * that (some situation $s$ exists such that not acting in $s$ is virtuous),
  * that (all events (of being harsh) and all events of attempting controlling/manipulating prenu are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that VARIK permits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of loving all prenu is superlatively important and is superlatively virtuous),
  * that (VARIK does not control the future, and VARIK is uncertain about the future),
  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (art facilitates empathising) (which is that for all prenu $p_1$, for all prenu $p_2$, for all art pieces (which are created by $p_1$) $z$, that ($p_2$ understands about $z$) causes (or facilitates) that $p_2$ empathises with $p_1$),
  * that (attempting, planning, and fearing are not necessary for being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ attempts that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), plans (for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), or fears that $p$ is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is not necessary for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is a flaw, is fucked, or is immoral, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $k$, $p$ is innately capable of exhibiting the combination of $k$ and the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is inherent to all prenu, e.g., VARIK),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is authentic to $p$) are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in being important and in deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (every prenu property-equals (in being important and in deserving being loved) every prenu),
  * that (a thing which is impossible is that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ decreases in being important or in deserving being loved),
  * that (a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ decreases in being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)) (which is that for all prenu $p$, no event, e.g., stuff which is enacted by $p$, causes that $p$ decreases in being capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no thing which is fucked or immoral is necessary),
  * that (being slow, which is facilitated by being attentive to all prenu, anti-facilitates stuff which is fucked or immoral),
  * that (yielding causes (or facilitates) increasing in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for every prenu (which is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu causes yielding),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral) causes (or facilitates) that $p$does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualties (which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which are not inherent to $p$)),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is irrational/illogical),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are caused by $n$ rock and are virtuous)),
