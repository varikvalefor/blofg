* that (VARIK is glad about that VARIK exhibits the property (of being transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),

  * that (fearing is not necessary),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is not necessary for that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$n$") is that ($p$ attempts $n$, plans for $n$, fears that ($n$ does not happen), or believes/is-certain/knows about the stuff which is caused/effected by $n$)),
