  * that (fearing is not necessary),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is not necessary for that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$n$") is that ($p$ attempts $n$, plans for $n$, fears that ($n$ does not happen), or believes/is-certain/knows about the stuff which is caused/effected by $n$)),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in being important and in deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (being is sufficient),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ decreases in being important or in deserving being loved),
  * that (every prenu property-equals {VERB} (in deserving being loved and in being important) every prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and $p$ is capable of being perfect/maximal in the property (of loving all prenu) and all qualities which are inherent to $p$, and all qualities which are inherent to $p$ are compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for every prenu (which is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields and understandingly permits that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is not pleasant for $p$)) causes that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for every prenu (which is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),

  * that ((for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inherent to $p$), and VARIK is an example),
  * that (every prenu, e.g., VARIK, property-equals (in being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) every prenu, e.g., SATAN),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that $p$, which is a prenu, is great, and is not an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$, is loved) causes that $p$ decreases in suffering),
  * that (for all events $n$, $n$ is an event of that no event which precedes $n$ is changed),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that some thing $z$ exists such that ($p$ enacts $z$, and that ($p$ enacts $z$) is contemporaneous with that $p$ understands that $z$ is immoral)),
  * that (the loving is sufficient (in being simple/whatever and in whatnot) for that linguistically defining loving is impossible),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that some prenu coerces/forces/whatever that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (linguistically describing loving is possible),
  * that (all events (of being harsh) and all events of attempting that prenu are controlled/manipulated/whatever are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all things which are fucked or immoral are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all things $x$, $x$ is virtuous if-and-only-if $x$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ "perfectly" forgets about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are enacted by $p$) $z$, forgiving (for enacting $z$) $p$ exceeds (in being (in accordance with the property of loving all prenu), in facilitating that (prenu decrease in suffering), and in faciliting that $p$ stops enacting stuff which resembles $z$) forgetting that $p$ enacts $z$),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu)
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is tired/exhausted by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being excessive in the property of loving all prenu is impossible) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for some thing which is fucked or immoral) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which are not inherent to $p$)) (which is that (the property of loving all prenu is incompatible with all stuff which is fucked or immoral, and for all prenu $p$, every event (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is an event (of that $p$ exhibits no quality which is fucked or immoral), and for all events $n_1$, for all events $n_1$, if $n_1$ exceeds (or equals) (in being an event of that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) $n_2$, then $n_2$ exceeds (or equals) (in being an event of that $p$ exhibits some quality which is fucked or immoral) $n_1$)),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, every event (of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) is an event (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in the property (of being important to $p) or whatever) the property of loving all prenu) (which is an event of that $p$ does not understand)) and is a part of the proof of that fearing is not necessary),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is enacted (by $p$) during $n$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (all stuff which should be done and is virtuous is obvious/natural/instinctive/easy for $p$), that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu, does not fear and is harmless to all prenu), that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whanot), that ($p$ indicates that fearing is not necessary), and that a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless),
