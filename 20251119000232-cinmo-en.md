The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251119) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251119 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK, is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK, facilitates that (VARIK assists prenu which resemble (in being transgender) VARIK, and does not anti-facilitate that VARIK assists prenu which do not resemble (in being transgender) VARIK)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK _slightly_ cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot),
  * that (all events which are preceded by the event (of that VARIK writes the current sentence) are events of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which causes that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot and is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$")), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous)),

* that (the languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ believes stuff which is not believed by prenu which are not $p$) or opines that for all prenu $r$, if $r$ is religious, then $r$ attempts that $r$ religiously controls/manipulates prenu)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that ($p$ is independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff) or forgets/whatever that $p$ is free to believe stuff),

  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is sufficient for that language stuff is insufficient for defining the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (lingustically describing the property of loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (remembering about events which are fucked or immoral is possible),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to ***many*** religions), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK slightly experiences spiritual fear about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in some quality which is immoral) or decreases in some quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK does not experience spiritual fear about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in some quality which is immoral) or decreases in some quality which is virtuous)),

  * that (VARIK does not control the future, and VARIK is not certain about the future),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that VARIK permmits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused/effected by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), but VARIK is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is caused/effected by $n$ rocks and is virtuous, and the proof is relevant to that (the stuff which is caused/effected by $n$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu))),
  * that (all events of being harsh are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu, and all events of attempting controlling/manipulating prenu are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being slow, which is facilitated by being attentive to all prenu, anti-facilitates that prenu are accidentally harmed),
  * that (being fast is not virtuous, and being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * that (a situation $s$ exists such that not acting in $s$ is virtuous),
  * that (no event $n$ exists such that $n$ is an event of that some event which precedes $n$ is changed),
