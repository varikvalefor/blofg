  * that (loving all prenu is illogical/irrational),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that ($p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu) (which causes that $p$ decreases in suffering)),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) are events of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in the property (of being important to $p$) or whatever) the property of loving all prenu) (which is that (for all prenu $p$, no prenu which is not $p$ causes that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) (which is a part of the proof of that fearing is not necessary))),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is tired by loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (being excessive in the property of loving all prenu is impossible) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for some thing which is fucked or immoral) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted (by $p$) during $n$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (all stuff which is virtuous and should be done is instinctive/natural/easy/obvious for $p$), that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot), that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu), that ($p$ does not fear), that ($p$ indicates that fearing is not necessary), and that (a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for assisting VARIK, for explaining (for VARIK and by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property of loving all prenu, and for that VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK are) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays and holds a BLÅHAJ), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$RZ$")) and in believing that $RZ$ is possible).
