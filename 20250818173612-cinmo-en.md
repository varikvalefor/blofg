The Emotions (which are Experienced (during 20250818) by VARIK) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (the thing indicates that the sleeping schedule of VARIK is "fixed")),
* that (VARIK non-extremely experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK remembers about the event of that VARIK fixes the 300mm f/4L, which is a camera lens and is used by VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (the camera which is used by VARIK is quiet such that birds do not fear the sound of the camera)),
* that (VARIK is annoyed... but amused... by that (VARIK is slow such that (difficult for VARIK are many events of photographing birds, and many photographs which are created by VARIK depict no birds))),
* that (VARIK opines that a thing indicates that VARIK increases in being appropriately disgusted by meat),
* that (VARIK attempts that VARIK reminds about that (stuff which is virtuous and rocks is possible with attempting)),
* that (VARIK fears (or whatever) that (VARIK decreases (in stuff which is virtuous) or increases in stuff which is immoral), a.k.a. "$B$", and hopes and attempts that $B$ does not happen),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with the events of that VARIK increases in all qualities which are virtuous, e.g., being vegan, and decreases in all qualities which are immoral, e.g., being angry at prenu),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that $B$ does not happen),
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is fucked and is immoral) but _extremely_ hopes for stuff which rocks and is virtuous)... and that VARIK attempts stuff which rocks and is virtuous.

## "Fixing" the Camera Lens
A sequence of events which happens is...

* that (the body of VARIK is in US-UT),
* that (the body of VARIK is in US-MD),
* that (VARIK discovers that the camera which is used by VARIK fails to focus the Canon EF 300mm f/4 USM (which is used by VARIK and for photographing birds), a.k.a. "$L$"),
* that (VARIK discovers that non-focusing is the fault of $L$ and-not the camera),
* that (VARIK discovers that (rotating $L$ causes that $L$ emits sound)... and that the cause of emitting sound is that (a lens element, a.k.a. "$L_3", moves)),
* that (VARIK becomes a thing which uses a lens which is not $L$),
* that (VARIK attempts to "fix" $L$), and
* that VARIK discovers that VARIK succeeds in fixing $L$.

### The Process of "Fixing" $L$
A sequence of events which happen and are parts of the process of "fixing" $L$ is...

* that (VARIK uses (for "removing" (from $L$) all lens elements which precede $L_3$) a lens wrench),
* that (VARIK submerges (in hydrogen peroxide) all lens elements which precede $L_3$),
* that (VARIK cleans all lens elements which precede $L_3$),
* that (VARIK "removes" (from $L$) $L_3$, which is loose),
* that (VARIK cleans $L_3$),
* that (VARIK "adds" (to the "version" $L$) $L_3$... and tightens $L_3$),
* that (VARIK dries all lens elements which precede $L_3$),
* that (VARIK cleans all lens elements which precede $L_3$), and
* that (VARIK "adds" (to the "version" of $L$) all lens elements which precede $L_3$).

## That (VARIK Fears (or Whatever) that VARIK Decreases in Qualities which are Virtuous)
VARIK fears (or whatever) that (VARIK decreases (in a quality which is virtuous) or increases in a quality which is immoral), a.k.a. "$B$".  "Justifications" of fearing (or whatever) include...

* that (many things are events of that (some thing which is immoral amuses VARIK), and being amused by stuff which is immoral facilitates permitting stuff which is immoral) and
* that (easy is not-caring, which facilitates that (stuff which is immoral is permitted or caused), which is immoral).

But VARIK does not worry idly about $B$.  VARIK attempts that ($B$ does not happen).  Methods of attempting include...

* the property (of attempting assisting (with decreasing in suffering) prenu),
* empathising (with all prenu),
* the property (of remembering that regardless of whether stuff which is immoral amuses, stuff which is immoral is immoral),
* the property (of thinking before acting),
* the property (of attempting to learn from actions which precede), and
* attempting (by doing stuff which rocks and is virtuous) that prenu, e.g., VARIK, remember that stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible.
