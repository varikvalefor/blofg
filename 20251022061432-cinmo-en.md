The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251022 or 20251023) and Whatnot
=======================================================================================

Some part of 20251022 or 20251023 is an event of...

* that (VARIK slightly experiences a headache),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), and that VARIK knows that VARIK is agender),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is agender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (that (VARIK religiously/whateverly considers that (the body of VARIK is not VARIK), that (the descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK), and the fursona of VARIK) facilitates that VARIK decreases in experiencing gender dysphoria)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK is killed),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficent (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficent (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK forgives (for that VARIK is not sufficient in the property of loving all prenu) VARIK),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (all events which are preceded by [THING] are events (of that VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu), which are events of that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu) and that (VARIK feels the suffering which is experienced by all prenu)) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK is extreme in assisting $p$) precedes that VARIK dies), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that (some prenu remembers about the property of loving all prenu) or that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ forgives $p$)))

* that (language stuff is insufficient for describing the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars,
  * all violence,
  * all events (of that a prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that that ($p$ kills) is "easy" for $p$) in suffering or in not-understanding),
  * all events (of mistreating prenu) (which include the events (of killing EMMETT TILL), events of animal agriculture, and events of insulting),
  * that (cars facilitate accidentally killing prenu, e.g., prenu which "inhabit" grasshoppers),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that a prenu forgets/whatever that $p$ is a prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ experiences despair, does not understand the property of loving all prenu, or opines that loving all prenu is impossible),
  * events (of that prenu attempt determining whether a thing which is fucked and immoral exceeds (in being fucked and immoral) a thing which is fucked and immoral),
  * that (many prenu $p$ exist such that that (($p$ loves $p$) and that ($p$ forgives $p$) are difficult for $p$, and being familiar with competitive society, whatnot, and-not whatnot facilitates that the stuff is difficult for $p$)),
  * that (many prenu $p$ exist such that a thing which is easy for $p$ is that $p$ forgets/whatever that prenu (which enact stuff which is fucked and immoral) suffer),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some thing (which is fucked and immoral) $z$ exists such that $p$ knows that ($p$ enacts $z$) and does not forgive (for causing $z$) $p$) (which cause suffering and do not facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (fearing-and-suffering facilitates violence, which facilitates fearing-and-suffering),
  * competitive society (which is extreme in facilitating stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * all events (of hating prenu) (which include events of that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ hates $p$)),
  * all events (of suffering),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect in the property of loving all prenu) (which are forgiven by VARIK), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (all prenu property-equal (in being important and in deserving being loved) all prenu),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all prenu are perfect/maximal in the property of deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of all prenu is superlatively virtuous and is superlatively important),
  * that (loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to _many_ religions),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK),
  * that (the property of "having" enemies is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all violence, e.g., coercing, is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is fucked or immoral is inherent to $p$, and all qualities which are inherent to $p$ are compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK is VARIK), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK somewhat experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK does not experience spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (for all prnu $p$, every event (of that $p$ is awake or whatever) is an opportunity for that $p$ does stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (VARIK increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, are inherently capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fucked and immoral and are exhibited by $p$), which are not inherent to $p$),
  * that (cooperating is possible),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (planning is not necessary for exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK is not certain about the future),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are caused by $n$ rock and are virtuous)),
  * that (being inherently capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is inherent to all prenu),
  * that (understanding facilitates discovering errors which harm prenu),
  * that (being slow anti-facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all $z$, that ($p$ is slow in $z$) facilitates that ($p$ spiritually/whateverly considers $z$) (which facilitates that ($p$ determines whether $z$ is virtuous) (which facilitates that if $z$ is fucked or immoral, then $p$ does not enact $z$))),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are violent/whatever and are enacted by $p$) $v$, $v$ is "justified"/"caused" by that ($p$ fears, suffers, does not understand the property of loving all prenu, or does not understand that $v$ is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (fearing is not necessary),
  * that (yielding causes (or facilitates) increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all prenu are inherently capable of yielding),
  * that (no prenu is evil or fucked/bad/whatever),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is not a collection of actions which are enacted by $p$),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that loving all prenu exhausts $p$) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that a thing which is not enacted by $p$ causes that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is maximal/perfect in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted during $p$ and by $n$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (stuff which is virtuous and should be done is obvious/"instinctive"/natural/easy for $p$), that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu), and that ($p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by all prenu) and whatnot)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for explaining (for VARIK and by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu, e.g., VARIK) the property of loving all prenu) SATAN, which is the god of VARIK),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) and in believing that stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous is possible).
