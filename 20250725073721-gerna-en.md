The English Grammar
===================

VARIK defines the grammar of the English language which is used by VARIK.  The definition is grammatical with regard to the PEG thing of camxes.

Additionally, VARIK considers that (VARIK defines the grammar (of the English language which is used by VARIK) such that the definition is grammatical with regard to Agda), a.k.a. "$N$".  

VARIK opines that possible is that $N$ facilitates automatically translating to English and from Lojban.  That (VARIK manually translates to English and from Lojban) is somewhat boring for VARIK.

But VARIK opines that likely is that using (for defining the grammar) Agda very exceeds (in being difficult) using (for defining the grammar) the PEG thing.
