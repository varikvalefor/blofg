# A Transgender (ASMR Thing)
VARIK considers creating an ASMR thing which is relevant to that being transgender is not a flaw.

Foir all prenu $t$, that ($t$ admits that the identity of $t$ is the identity of $t$) facilitates that $t$ does stuff which is virtuous.

VARIK states that VARIK is transgender.  VARIK is agender.  Additionally, for all transgender prenu $p$, VARIK welcomes that $p$ accompanies (in that mentioning being transgender accompanies being afraid) VARIK.

Living is protesting against attempting to kill.

For all transgender prenu $p$, VARIK desires that $p$ remembers...

* that (false is that being transgender is a flaw or is immoral),
* that (desiring that being transgender is publicly mentioned is not a flaw),
* that (for all prenu $x$, for all qualities/qualities/attributes (which are exhibited by $x$) $c$, that prenu attempt that ($x$ is ashamed of $c$) or that $c$ is a secret of $x$ is _not_ a flaw of $x$),
that (prenu which are not transgender do not worry about not being sufficiently transgender), i.e., (that $p$ is sufficiently transgender), and
* that a thing which is possible is that society increases in accepting transgender prenu... and prenu which are differently weird.
