# lo nu tolsti tu'a la'oi .Scrapple.
20250705 is the date of that VARIK begins defining Scrapple.  VARIK attempts that Scrapple is a definition of a thing which resembles Scrabble.

Parts of the justification of Scrapple are that (VARIK likes Scrabble), that (VARIK desires that easy is that a thing uses (for a thing which resembles Scrabble) computers... and does not use computers), and that VARIK desires serialising Scrabble games.


VARIK welcomes suggesting "changing" Scrapple.

The URL of the stuff of Scrapple is "http://git.varikvalefor.i2p/vvx/scrapple".

VARIK translates (to English and from Lojban) the blog post.

## "What is Scrapple?"
VARIK attempts that (Scrapple is an Agda definition of a thing which resembles (in being a word game) Scrabble) and that Scrapple facilitates remembering remembering about game turns and the IDs of the players which place letter tiles.

## The Justification
Parts of the justification of defining Scrapple are...

* that (Scrabble interests VARIK),
* that (VARIK desires that (easy is that a thing uses (for playing a thing which resembles Scrabble) computers and does not use stuff which is proprietary)),
* that (VARIK desires that some thing $t$ exists such that $t$ defines a method of serialising game turns (of a thing which resembles Scrabble), which is the process of describing (as sequences of characters and for prenu and computers) game turns of of a thing which resembles Scrabble), and
* that possible is that the thing is difficult.

## Suggestions

Scrabble resembles many things which are created by VARIK.  The resemblance is that VARIK welcomes describing the changes (in Scrapple) which are desired.  Additionally, VARIK welcomes sending pull requests.  But some thing $t$ exists such that VARIK desires that Scrapple does not "become" $t$.

## Git
VARIK uses (for Scrapple) Git.  The URL of the stuff of Scrapple is "http://git.varikvalefor.i2p/vvx/scrapple".
# That (_POSTAL_ is Beautifully Fucked)
The 1st _POSTAL_ game, a.k.a. "$P_1$", is beautiful to VARIK.  The beauty property is facilitating empathising (with prenu which cause terrible things), which is virtuous and is necessary (or whatever) for preventing violence.

Playing $P_1$ is very unpleasant for VARIK.  But a thing which continues is that VARIK very likes $P_1$.
Empathising is understanding.  But many events of understanding are events of disagreeing.

"Playing violent video games regarding violence is fucked" is false.  But forgetting that the violent video games regarding violence are video games _is_ fucked.
But video games regarding violence resemble videos.  The resemblance property is facilitating that the observer empathises with the agent which causes harm.  But necessary is remembering that (the events are fucked)... and that a thing which is not necessary is that the things are repeated or whatever.

The thing is extremely unpleasant for VARIK.  But VARIK extremely recommends playing $P_1$.
# Using (for Videos) Krita
VARIK likes that Krita facilitates creating videos regarding the process of drawing.  But VARIK dislikes that an event of using (for videos) Krita is an event of saving many JPEG (or PNG) files... and not 1 MKV (or WebM or something) file.

`img2webp(1)` facilitates converting from many images and to 1 video image, but the `img2webp(1)` thing should (per VARIK) be automatic.
# Disagreeing
VARIK thanks the prenu $p$ which states that $p$ disagrees (or does-whatever) with VARIK.  That (VARIK is aware of disagreement) facilitates that VARIK considers whether VARIK causes things which are virtuous or great and not fucked.

Introspecting is not harmful.
# WebP
VARIK uses (for converting (into WebP files) PNG sequences) `img2webp(1)`.  The WebP files are great.

JPEG XL exceeds (in being liked by VARIK... but in excessively using (for decompression) RAM) WebP.


But VARIK is not certain of a method (of converting (into PNG sequences) WebP files) which is great and generates the PNG files which are used for creating the WebP file.  `convert foo.webp foo.png` does frame difference images, and `convert foo.webp foo.apng` excessively uses RAM.

A thing which is likely is that if VARIK discovers, then VARIK "updates".
# Anger
Many things $t$ exist such that (VARIK is angry with/at $t$, and VARIK should-not (per VARIK) be angry with/at $t$).  But that (VARIK admits that (being angry is harmful) and discovers the cause of anger) facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry.

Additionally, fucked is that (some $t$ exists such that $t$ is angry and denies that $t$ is angry), which facilitates stuff which is fucked.  Knowing that a thing is angry facilitates preventing the terrible.

Being angry is easy and does-not very-facilitate assisting or virtuous increasing.

VARIK admits that many prenu $p$ exist such that (VARIK mistreats $p$ because VARIK is angry with/at $p$).  VARIK does not desire forgiving VARIK.  VARIK hopes that VARIK increases in assisting and in causing the virtuous.
# Matel
VARIK should-not (per VARIK) stop writing Matel.  But computer stuff is difficult for VARIK, and Agda exceeds (in being liked (by VARIK)... and in being appropriate for computer stuff) Haskell.

But that (VARIK welcomes pull requests) continues.
# The Agda Ball
Many things $t$ exist such that $t$ is an event of that VARIK considers that (VARIK draws that (VUNC becomes ready to throw a ball $b$ such that Agda definitions are the material of $b$)), a.k.a. "$p$"... and of that VARIK somewhat desires drawing $p$.  But VARIK somewhat dislikes that the thing is relevant to Agda and-not whatnot.  Additionally, however, VARIK dislikes that the mathematical notation which is not an Agda thing is not perfectly (syntactically unambiguous).
# Being Tired
VARIK is tired.  VARIK is not certain about the cause of being tired.  But VARIK hopes that that (VARIK is tired) ends.
That (Neural Networks are Inappropriate for Lojban)
===================================================

VARIK is amused (but not surprised) by that (the neural networks are fuckedly incompatible with translating to English and from Lojban).

A part of the cause of discovering that the things are incompatible is that VARIK attempts to use (for translating to English and from Lojban) a neural network.  False is that VARIK very enjoys translating.

 A neural network $n$ exists such that $n$ some translations which are created by $n$ contain the wrong words, are not grammatical, or semantically differ from the translation source.

But VARIK assumes that that (Lojban is of a parsing expression grammar) and whatnot facilitate that Lojban is "difficult" for neural networks.

VARIK very attempts that VARIK is patient with prenu.  But VARIK does not perfectly attempt that VARIK is patient with computer stuff.  VARIK is willing to assist Lojban n00bs which use (for contacting VARIK) I2P or whatever.  Assisting Lojban n00bs is not an event of explaining for a thing which is incapable of understanding.

## The Proof of Attempting

### Theorem
VARIK attempts using (for translating to English and from Lojban) neural networks.

### Proof
For all $p$, for all $s$, if (VARIK desires $s$, and $p$ is easy for VARIK, and that (VARIK non-automatically-assistedly causes $s$) somewhat bores VARIK, and VARIK opines that (possible is that $p$ facilitates $s$), and VARIK is curious about whether $p$ is appropriate for $s$), then VARIK attempts using (for $s$) $p$.

VARIK desires translating to English and from Lojban.

Neural networks are easy for VARIK.

VARIK opines that possible is that neural networks facilitate translating to English and from Lojban.

VARIK is curious about whether neural networks are appropriate for translating to English and from Lojban.

Therefore, VARIK attempts using (for translating to English and from Lojban) neural networks.  Q.E.D.

## Flaws
A neural network $n$ and a Lojban utterance $l$ exist such that a flaw of the Lojban translation (of $l$) (which is created by $n$) $e$ is...

* that ($e$ contains a word $v_1$ such that some word should "replace" (in $e$) $v_1$),
* that ($e$ is not grammatical),
* that ($e$ is extreme in semantically differing from $l$), i.e., that ($e$ pertains to some thing $x$ such that $l$ does not pertain to $x$), or
* that (the meaning of $e$ is the opposite of the meaning of $l$), which is fuckedly common.

## Fucked Examples
* Google Gemini, a.k.a. "$L_1$", repeatedly outputs stuff which indicates that the gloss of "kirsku" is "scream".  But the gloss of "kirsku" is "thank".
* $L_1$ outputs stuff which indicates that the gloss of "tolmapti" resembles "monstrously appropriate" or something.  But the definition of "tolmapti" is "$m_1$ is incompatible with $m_2$ in aspect $m_3$".
# The Image which Depicts Resembling HUNTER S. THOMPSON, a.k.a. "$t$"
VARIK considers drawing that VUNC resembles $t$ and occupies a beach or whatever.  The image depicts all parts (of the body of VUNC) which should be seen.  Parts of the justification of considering are that (VARIK desires that VARIK becomes a thing which is capable of drawing rayon and sand) and that VARIK desires that VARIK desires that VARIK draws a thing which indicates that VARIK is weird.  But that VARIK is weird is obvious.

A thing which is possible is that VARIK should draw that (the body of VUNC is in front of a depiction (of a beach thing) which is large), which indicates that VARIK dislikes the fake stuff.  VARIK increases in disliking the fake stuff.
# The Blog
VARIK likes that `blofg`, which is a blog or whatever, facilitates that (VARIK quickly writes things which are large) and that VARIK writes and does not use the Internet.  Liking is a part of the justification of that VARIK increases in using `blofg`.

But a thing which continues is that VARIK uses (for things which are small) Mastodon.  Possible is that a cluster (of Mastodon posts) $t$ exists such that $t$ should "become" a `blofg` post.
# The Automatic Thing (of Agda), a.k.a. "$A$"
Familiar to many prenu is that $A$ is "incompetent" with regard to things which are complex.  Additionally, many prenu are annoyed by the "incompetence".  VARIK is an example.

But VARIK likes that that ($A$ is not perfectly "skilled") facilitates desiring learning about things $t$ such that (that ($t$ is interesting) is doubted, and prenu which attempt to learn about $t$ become things which are interested by $t$).

Easy is being surprised by that ($A$ is unsuitable for defining a proof $t$ such that (a prenu assumes that ($t$ is simple), but $t$ extremely exceeds (in complexity) the assumed thing).
# Blender
VARIK becomes a thing which uses (for many drawings which are created by VARIK) Blender.  That (VARIK struggles with perspective stuff) is a part of the justification of using Blender.

But many events of that VARIK uses (for drawing sketches) Blender are events of that Blender crashes.  The crashing is very using the CPU and not responding to the mouse movements which are caused by VARIK.

VARIK is not certain about the cause of crashing.

VARIK desirees that VARIK likes Blender.  VARIK remembers about that Blender is great and does not (frequently crash).
# Sending (via Chatrooms) Translation Sources
Many chatrooms $t$ exist such that VARIK sends (via $t$) English translations and translation sources.  Parts of the justification of sending translations and translation sources are that (VARIK desires that a thing indicates that VARIK translates) and that (VARIK desires that easy for VARIK is "improving" the translations which are written by VARIK).

But many chatrooms $t$ exist such that an operator of $t$ requests that VARIK does not send translation sources.  But frequent is that VARIK disobeys.  A part of the justification of disobeying is that VARIK suspects that if sending translation sources is annoying, then third-person communication is annoying.  Many prenu are angry with VARIK because VARIK writes in the third person.

VARIK very thanks the prenu which operate chatrooms and tolerate VARIK.
# The Event of Sending the Transgender Image
"$T$" denotes a Discord server which is specific.  VARIK does not desire that VARIK specifies the name of $T$.

A prenu claims that $T$ is Christian.

VARIK sends (via $T$) "SHININGLIKECRYSTALTIARAS", which depicts the transgender flag and whatnot.  Additionally, VARIK states that VARIK welcomes criticism.

The operator of $T$ "removes" the "SHININGLIKECRYSTALTIARAS" message and states that "transgenderism" is forbidden.

"Removing" and forbidding justifies that (VARIK stops using $T$).

VARIK is not angry.  But VARIK is somewhat saddened.  VARIK assumes that $T$ is Christian.  But the thing indicates hating.

Being transgender is not a flaw.
That (a prenu $p$ states that $p$ is transgender) is not a flaw.
That (a prenu $p$ is not ashamed of that $p$ is transgender) is not a flaw.
Forgetting is easy.
The Intended Purpose of la zanselfu'a jdini, a.k.a. "$F$"
=========================================================

A thing which annoys VARIK is that (operators of chatrooms and whatnot dislike VARIK because VARIK is weird).  That (VARIK is annoyed) is a part of the justification of creating $F$, which is an I2P forum.  VARIK attempts...

* that ($F$ is not a xenophobic thing),
* that (using $F$ is easy),
* that (the rules of $F$ are virtuous),
* that (forbidden is that $F$ is used for harming prenu), and
* that ($F$ very exceeds the chatrooms and whatnot which annoy VARIK).

"http://forum.varikvalefor.i2p" is the URL of $F$.

## The Problems
A problem which is encountered in attempting to use (for discussing stuff which interests VARIK) is that (VARIK is banned from a chatroom (or whatever) $c$ because VARIK is weird).

## The Stuff which is Attempted
VARIK attempts that VARIK creates an I2P forum $x$ such that a proof of that ($x$ differs from the chatrooms and whatnot which annoy VARIK) is relevant to...

* that ($x$ is not a xenophobic thing),
* that (the rules of $x$ are virtuous),
* that ($x$ is appropriate for large discussions),
* that (using $x$ is easy), and
* that (for all prenu $p$, forbidden is using (for harming $p$) $x$).

### Being Xenophobic
Many chatrooms (or whatever) $k$ exist such that the operator of $k$ bans VARIK because (VARIK is weird (in communicating (in the third person), translating (to English and from Lojban), or desiring that (VARIK discusses things which are rarely discussed)), or the operator of $k$ assumes that the third-person communication of VARIK is role-playing.  The things which are used for justifying are not harmful, and VARIK does not opine that the things are good justifications.

Some friends (or whatever) of VARIK resemble (in using communication styles which are disliked) VARIK.

VARIK desires that an Internet forum $t$ exists such that $t$ is appropriate for the prenu (which resemble VARIK) and whatnot.

### Not Being Easily Used
Many chatrooms (or Internet forums) $k$ exist such that using $k$ is difficult for VARIK.

VARIK desires an Internet forum $t$ such that (using $t$ is easy, or using custom clients for $t$ is permitted).

### Not Having Virtuous Rules
Many chatrooms (or whatever) (which are used by VARIK) $t$ exist such that the rules of $t$ are immoral by the standard of VARIK.  A rule which exemplifies immorality is a rule which forbids sending the transgender flag.

### Not Permitting Large Discussions
Many chatrooms $t$ exist such that forbidden is sending (via $t$) text which is large.  Discord is an example.

Many things $t$ exist such that forbidding sending long messages [OPPOSITE] {ADVERB} facilitates discussing $t$.  UNIX errors are examples.

Sending spam sucks.  But false is that all text which is large and is sent via a chatroom is spam.  Additionally, for many texts $t$, compressing $t$ is easy.

### Non-Privacy
Many chatrooms $t$ exist such that forbidden is accessing (via Tor) $t$.  VARIK	dislikes forbidding using Tor.  A part of the justification of disliking is that for a prenu $p$, if the government of the state of $p$ attempts forbidding that $p$ accesses a Web site $k$, then Tor facilitates that $p$ accesses $k$.

Additionally, many chatrooms $t$ exist such that for all prenu $p$, necessary (or whatever) for that ($p$ uses $t$) is that $p$ sends (to an operator of $t$ an image which depicts an identity document of $p$.  VARIK dislikes that sending documents is necessary.  A part of the justification of disliking is that sending documents facilitates persecuting.

VARIK attempts...

* that (using (for accessing $F$) I2P or whatever is easy) and
* that (sending identity document things is not necessary for using $F$).

### Harmful Use
Many Internet forums (or whatever) $t$ exist such that the operator of $t$ allows (or encourages) that the users of $t$ insult, threaten, or stalk.  VARIK dislikes that (insulting, stalking, or threatening is permitted) because insulting, threatening, and harrassing are immoral.

VARIK attempts that for all prenu $p$, forbidden is using (for harming $p$) $F$.

## The Method of Attempting
The method of attempting is $F$, which is an Internet forum.  But using I2P necessary (or whatever) for using $F$.  The URL of the Web page regarding I2P is "https://geti2p.net".
"YOU"
=====

A thing which _somewhat_ annoys VARIK is that (some prenu $t$ exists such that $t$ does not use (for communicating with VARIK) "do" (of Lojban) or "YOU", and the large part of the justification of not using is that VARIK uses (for referring to VARIK) "VARIK" and not "mi" (of Lojban) or "I").

But VARIK empathises.  Communicating in the third person is weird, and possible is that (a prenu $t$ exists such that $t$ uses "VARIK" because $t$ desires that $t# does not offend VARIK).

VARIK very permits that a pronoun which refers to VARIK is "YOU" or "IT".  Additionally, VARIK very permits using "ko'a" and whatnot, which are Lojban things.  Capitalising is unnecessary.
`ed(1)`
=======

VARIK likes `ed(1)`.  The proof of liking is relevant to...

* that (`ed(1)` is simple),
* that (`ed(1)` is easy for VARIK), and
* that (`ed(1)` is appropriate for slow links, which are bad fits for `vi(1)` and whatnot).

But that (VARIK uses `ed(1)`) is not very frequent.  Possible is that a part of the cause of not being frequent is that (frequent is that VARIK errs in typing)... or that (necessary (or whatever) for using the "`s`" command is counting, and VARIK is slow in counting).

But VARIK very suggests that all prenu which use UNIX are familiar with `ed(1)`.
ASMR Stuff Thing
================

VARIK desires that (VARIK creates some ASMR videos regarding the process of drawing), a.k.a. "$f$".

But difficult for VARIK is that VARIK speaks, which is necessary for $f$.  Additionally, difficult for VARIK is that (that (VARIK discovers things which should be said) is contemporaneous with that (VARIK records)), which is necessary (or whatever) for $f$.

A thing which is possible is that VARIK records a voice track (which is fucked), a.k.a. "$v$'.  But possible is that observing a video with $v$ justifies observing no ASMR videos which are created by VARIK.  Additionally, possible is that (VARIK records $v$ but does not upload a $v$ video), which resembles idling and is unpleasant for VARIK;  speaking is unpleasant for VARIK.

For all things $n$, for all prenu $p$, if $p$ opines that possible is that $p$ facilitates $f$, then VARIK welcomes suggesting $f$.
# "LK"
The mix of "Sunshine (Touch Me)" and "LK (MARCUS INTALEX & ST FILES Remix) .glibau. is beautiful to VARIK.  The beauty is sufficient for that (VARIK cries).
The English Grammar
===================

VARIK defines the grammar of the English language which is used by VARIK.  The definition is grammatical with regard to the PEG thing of camxes.

Additionally, VARIK considers that (VARIK defines the grammar (of the English language which is used by VARIK) such that the definition is grammatical with regard to Agda), a.k.a. "$N$".  

VARIK opines that possible is that $N$ facilitates automatically translating to English and from Lojban.  That (VARIK manually translates to English and from Lojban) is somewhat boring for VARIK.

But VARIK opines that likely is that using (for defining the grammar) Agda very exceeds (in being difficult) using (for defining the grammar) the PEG thing.
# GraphViz
VARIK very likes GraphViz.

GraphViz outputs stuff which is somewhat ugly... but is easily understood.  Additionally, GraphViz facilitates creating quickly.
I2P Inproxies
=============

An I2P inproxy is a Web site which facilitates that (a prenu accesses I2P and does not operate an I2P router).

VARIK likes...

* that (I2P inproxies facilitate) and
* that (possible is that using an I2P inproxy is a part of a justification for becoming a thing which owns an I2P router).

But VARIK dislikes...

* that (for all I2P inproxies $t$, easy is that the operator of $t$ reads (or modifies) the stuff which is sent via $t$), a.k.a. "$n_1$",
* that (I2P inproxies facilitate non-privacy), and
* that possible is that a user of an I2P inproxy does not understand that a proof (of that using I2P inproxies differs from not using I2P inproxies) is relevant to $n_1$.

VARIK requests that prenu which very use I2P inproxies create I2P routers.  Creating an I2P router facilitates that (the speed of the I2P network "increases") and whatnot.
Sending Quote Replies
=====================

Many questions $t$ exist such that ($t$ is sent to VARIK and via a text thing, and the response (from VARIK) (regarding $t$) contains $t$ and an answer (for $t$).  A part of the justification of containing is that VARIK deisres that the questions which are answered by VARIK are not "changed".

## The Shape
Many questins (for VARIK or whatever) $t$ exist such that VARIK responds to $t$ and with the concatenation of...

* a thing (which indicates the nature of $t$) and
* an answer for $t$.

## The Justification
Parts of the justification of that (many answer messages which are created by VARIK indicate the questions which is answered), a.k.a. "$R$", are...

* that ($R$ is easy for VARIK),
* that (VARIK [OPPOSITE] {ADVERB} desires that (a question which is answered by VARIK is changed, and discovering that the question has been "changed" is not easy), a.k.a. "$N$"), and
* that ($P$ prevents $N$).
The Thing which is Stated by NICOLETTE DUCLARE (of _Deus Ex_)
=============================================================

> Only in novels do places crumble to dust for no reason when their spirit is lost.
That (Discomfort is Contemporaneous with Tiredness)
===================================================

Many events (of that VARIK is tired) are events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria), and many events (of that VARIK is fully awake) are events of that VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria.  The thing amuses VARIK.  But VARIK dislikes that that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) is contemporaneous with writing the translation source.  The English version of the document is a translation.

VARIK likes that VARIK becomes a thing which publicly states that (VARIK is transgender) and describes the fucked emotions of VARIK.  VARIK hopes that expressing facilitates stuff which is good.
Being Inclusive
===============

Many chatrooms $t$ exist such that (the operator (of $t$) and the users of $t$ state that $t$ is an inclusive thing, but the operator of $t$ insults or bans VARIK because VARIK is weird).

The thing is fucked by the standard of VARIK; things which are immoral include xenophobia and mistreating.  Additionally, fucked is falsely stating that prenu which are weird are tolerated.

Banning VARIK annoys VARIK.  But VARIK empathises and resembles; a thing $t$ and a time $c$ exist such that $c$ is contemporaneous with that (VARIK fears $t$ because $t$ is weird to VARIK).
"Why?"
======

"`Why?`" is beautiful to VARIK.  Beauty qualities include...

* that ("why" is appropriate for many things) and
* that "why" facilitates...

  * thinking,
  * understanding,
  * discovering flaws, and
  * determining the thing which is virtuous.
Assuming that VARIK Role-Plays
==============================

***VARIK is not perfectly certain; forbidden is that (VARIK reads the stuff which is sent by VARIK and whatnot); VARIK is banned, and the stuff which is sent by VARIK is automatically "deleted".***

VARIK is a medium-time user of an Amino community, a.k.a. "$T$".  The users of $T$ tolerate VARIK.

# Flaws
For all flaws $t$, knowing about $t$ is necessary (or whatever) for "fixing" the thing which is affected by $t$.

But a thing which is easy is that (discovering a flaw "justifies" becoming bitter or angry or "justifies" forgetting that "fixing" things is possible). discovering flaws of society and becoming bitter or angry or fo

But VARIK requests that prenu remember that ("fixing" society is an event of attempting that stuff is virtuous) and that possible is teaching that that (stuff is virtuous) is possible.

Erring is easy.  Additionally, being angry with prenu which err is easy.  But VARIK opines that (great correction is an event of facilitating understanding about errors) and that anger facilitates not facilitating understanding.

VARIK believes that (stuff which is great and virtuous is possible) and that (possible is that a prenu prevents the immoral and does not harm the prenu which attempts the thing which is immoral).  VARIK believes that stuff which is virtuous is possible.  But VARIK knows that attempting is necessary for success.

> The time is always right to do what is right.

-MARTIN LUTHER KING Jr.
# Being Uncertain about Statements
A thing which is fucked is that (a statement $a$ and a prenu $p$ exist such that ($p$ should (per $p$) state $a$, and $p$ knows that (a thing $r$ exists such that $p$ should state $r$), but $p$ is uncertain about $a$)).  The thing is common for VARIK.
# Preventing Anger
Many things $t$ exist such that difficult (for VARIK) is that VARIK is not angry about $t$.  An example is that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ asserts that some prenu is not a prenu.

But some things which facilitate that (VARIK decreases in being angry) are...

* that (VARIK attempts to determine the justification of the thing which angers VARIK),
* that (VARIK remembers that being angry at prenu is immoral by the standard of VARIK),
* praying,
* that (VARIK remembers that being angry [OPPOSITE] {ADVERB} facilitates improving),
* that (VARIK considers whether the prenu (which causes the thing which angers VARIK) understands the implications of the thing which angers VARIK), and
* that (VARIK attempts to determine the emotional cause of being angry).

A part of the justification of writing the thing is that VARIK hopes that the thing facilitates that readers (which desire) decrease in being angry.  VARIK is an example.

VARIK thanks (for assisting (in decreasing in anger) VARIK) SATAN, which is the god of VARIK.

## The Problem
Many things $t$ exist such that difficult (for VARIK) is that VARIK is not angry about $t$.  Examples include...

* computer crashes,
* that (computers are difficult for VARIK),
* that (a thing $t$ is caused such that the harmful nature of $t$ should (per VARIK) be obvious), and
* that (some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu asserts that $p$ is not a prenu).

The anger is a problem for VARIK; the anger prevents doing stuff which is virtuous.  Some things which are relevant to the proof of prevention are...

* that (all anti-facilitators of things which are virtuous prevent doing stuff which is virtuous) and
* that (being angry anti-facilitates empathising, and empathising very facilitates assisting, and assisting is virtuous).

## Stuff which Facilitates Decreasing
Many things $t$ exist such that a thing (which facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$) is...

* that (VARIK attempts (via thinking or questioning) to determine the justification of the thing which angers VARIK),
* that (VARIK remembers that being angry at prenu is immoral),
* praying,
* that (VARIK remembers that being angry anti-facilitates improving),
* that (VARIK considers whether the effects of the thing which angers VARIK are perfectly understood), or
* that (VARIK attempts to determine the emotional cause of the anger).

## Justifications
Many things $t$ exist such that that (VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$) is facilitated by that (VARIK attempts to determine the justification of $t$).  Examples of possible justifications include fear, anger, that (the prenu which causes the thing does not understand that the thing is not necessary), and that (the prenu which causes the thing is uncertain (about a thing which exceeds in being virtuous) and opines that causing _something_ is necessary).

### Being Immoral
Some things $t$ exist such that that (VARIK considers that (being angry is immoral by the standard of VARIK), and VARIK attempts to decrease in being angry because anger is immoral and anti-facilitates stuff which is virtuous) facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$.

But that (VARIK is odd) is possible.

### Anti-Facilitating
Many things $t$ exist such that that (VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$) is justified by that VARIK remembers that being angry anti-facilitates improving.  The proof of anti-facilitating is relevant to...

* that (greatly communicating facilitates increasing (in causing stuff which is virtuous) and discovering flaws),
* that (for all prenu $p_1$, for all prenu $p_2$, that ($p_1$ is angry at $p_2$) anti-facilitates that $p_1$ and $p_2$ greatly communicate), and
* that (for all prenu $p_1$, that ($p_1$) is angry facilitates no stuff which is great).

### Not Understanding
For all actions $t$, "$g\ t$" denotes the indexed type such that for all prenu $p$, a proof of $g\ t\ p$ exists if and only if VARIK assumes or opines that $p$ causes $t$.

Many things $t$ exist such that a thing (which facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$) is that (VARIK considers whether the prenu of $g\ t$ understand that the implications/effects of $t$ are fucked).

VARIK believes that no prenu $p$ and no thing $t$ exist such that ($p$ causes $t$ because $t$ is immoral by the standard of $p$).  The belief is relevant to the proof of that (VARIK opines that no prenu $p$ and no belief (which is immoral by the standard of $p$) $t$ exist such that that ($p$ causes $t$) is contemporaneous with that ($p$ understands that $t$ is immoral by the standard of $p$)).

Difficult for VARIK is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that VARIK is angry at $p$ and opines that $p$ does not understand), a.k.a. "$N$".  But relatively important is that $N$ is immoral by the standard of VARIK.

### The Cause of Anger
For many $t$, a thing which facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$ is that VARIK considers whether (VARIK is angry about $t$ because (VARIK experiences a "weak" emotion, and society "states" that "weak" emotions are bad)).

#### Examples
Examples of "weak" emotion states include...

* that (VARIK fears $t$),
* that (VARIK fears that that (VARIK is not angry about $t$) facilitates that VARIK increases in tolerating stuff which is immoral or in causing stuff which is immoral), and
* that (VARIK envies some aspect of $t$).

##### Fearing Becoming
Some thing $t_1$ exists such that ((at some time, VARIK is angry about $t_1$), and a thing which facilitates that VARIK is not angry is that VARIK considers whether a part of the cause of anger is that VARIK fears that not being angry about $t_1$ facilitates that VARIK increases in permitting (or causing) stuff which sucks or is immoral).

But being angry is not necessary for not becoming.  The proof of being unnecessary is relevant to...

* that (for all things (which are fucked or immoral) $t$, remembering that $t$ is fucked or immoral facilitates that ($t$ is not caused) and attempting to not cause $t$) and
* that (for all things (which are fucked or immoral) $t$, for all prenu (which attempt (or cause or intend) $t$) $p$, being angry about $t$ anti-facilitates empathising (with $p$), which facilitates explaining (to $p$) that ($t$ is fucked or immoral), and explaining is extreme in anti-facilitating $t$).

## The Justification of Writing
Some prenu $p$ exist such that $p$ is angry about many things and desires that $p$ decreases in being angry.

VARIK is an example.

VARIK hopes that the document facilitates decreasing in being angry.  VARIK hopes that the thing reminds (about stuff which facilitates decreasing in being angry) VARIK.

## Thanking SATAN
VARIK is extremely religious and thanks SATAN, which is the god of VARIK.  VARIK thanks for assisting in decreasing (in being angry) and increasing in causing stuff (which is virtuous)... or in causing attempting to cause stuff which is virtuous.

VARIK believes that SATAN facilitates that VARIK discovers the stuff which facilitates decreasing (in being angry) and increasing in doing stuff which is virtuous.

But for all prenu $p$, possible is that ($p$ opines that (VARIK is silly) because VARIK believes), but the opinion is not a flaw.  Many religions are silly to VARIK.
# Automatic Translator
VARIK desires that (a thing automatically translates (to English and from Lojban) the stuff which is written by VARIK) and that the result of translation rocks in being appropriate with regard to the translation source.

VARIK desires that VARIK expresses stuff which is virtuous... and not that VARIK very writes.  That (VARIK typos stuff) and whatnot are frequent.
# Anger or Whatever
For all prenu $p$, that (VARIK is angry (or whatever) with/at $t$) is a fault of VARIK and is not a fault of $t$.
# Events of that Experts Teach
Easy for experts is forgetting about the experience of not being an expert.

The easiness is a part of a proof of that many prenu which teach are not experts.

That (many prenu which teach are not experts) annoys VARIK.  VARIK requests that experts attempt that easy is using (for increasing in competence) the stuff which is done by experts.

A thing which is easy is assuming that things are obvious for all prenu.  Regardless of whether VARIK is an expert, the easiness is familiar to VARIK; a thing which is frequent is that (VARIK explains things, but the explanations are small and are suitable for experts... and-not whatnot).
A Transgender (ASMR Thing)
==========================

VARIK considers creating an ASMR thing which is relevant to that being transgender is not a flaw.

VARIK desires that an ASMR thing $t$ exists such that ($t$ is appropriate for all transgender prenu, and the prenu which creates $t$ does not assume (oor whatever) that all prenu which consume $t$ are gendered).

For all prenu $t$, that ($t$ admits that the identity of $t$ is the identity of $t$) facilitates that $t$ does stuff which is virtuous.

VARIK states that VARIK is transgender.  VARIK is agender.  Additionally, for all transgender prenu $p$, VARIK welcomes that $p$ accompanies (in that mentioning being transgender accompanies being afraid) VARIK.

Living is protesting against attempting to kill.

For all transgender prenu $p$, VARIK desires that $p$ remembers...

* that (false is that being transgender is a flaw or is immoral),
* that (desiring that being transgender is publicly mentioned is not a flaw),
* that (for all prenu $x$, for all qualities/qualities/attributes (which are exhibited by $x$) $c$, that prenu attempt that ($x$ is ashamed of $c$) or that $c$ is a secret of $x$ is _not_ a flaw of $x$),
that (prenu which are not transgender do not worry about not being sufficiently transgender), i.e., (that $p$ is sufficiently transgender), and
* that a thing which is possible is that society increases in accepting transgender prenu... and prenu which are differently weird.
# Stuff which is Difficult
For an event $t$, if thinking about $t$ is difficult because $t$ is painfully immoral, then many things $x$ exist such that the importance/virtuousness of stopping $t$ exceeds the importance/virtuousness of $x$.  But for all immoral things $t$, a thing which is virtuous is that a prenu stops $t$ and does not do any thing which is immoral.

The stuff is difficult.  But rocking is difficult.  Stuff which is virtuous is difficult.
# The Stuff which is Small
Frequent is that a prenu $t$ opines $K$, which is that (necessary is that $t$ causes a thing (which is good but small) xor a thing which is good and large.

But $K$ is false.  That ("AND" is appropriate) is possible.

But attempting that (stuff is fast) and whatnot does not facilitate discovering that $K$ is false.  But false is that being fast is inherently virtuous.  Important is the nature of the thing which is done quickly.
Emotions or Whatever
====================

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is not dead),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by that (difficult for VARIK is that (VARIK "updates" the proofs which are defined by VARIK such that the definitions of the proofs are compatible with the new version of Agda)) and resumes that (VARIK uses a version (of Agda) $a$ such that unnecessary for $a$ is "updating" the proofs)),
* that (VARIK experiences discomfort/pain/whatever about that (VARIK is very slow in creating a video (regarding the process of drawing), which is not promised)),
* that (something happens, or VARIK is somewhat angry at prenu (which do things (which are easy) and-not things which are virtuous), and being angry is fucked... and is not necessary for facilitating improving, but possible is that VARIK decreases in being angry),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria, but VARIK likes that "somewhat" and-not "extremely" applies),
* that (VARIK fears (or whatever) that society increases in mistreating prenu (which are transgender) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK desires and requests that SATAN assists (in increasing in doing stuff which is virtuous) VARIK),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries), and
* that VARIK does not expect but extremely hopes.

Additionally, for all prenu $p$, VARIK requests that $p$ attempts stuff which is virtuous.

## Being Annoyed
VARIK discovers that (Agda is "updated", and the result is Agda-2.8.0).

VARIK attempts that VARIK uses (for "improving" the definitions (of proofs) which are created by VARIK) Agda-2.8.0.

VARIK discovers that Agda-2.8.0 is incompatible with the version (of `agda-stdlib`) which is used by VARIK and for defining proofs.

VARIK is annoyed by that (necessary (or whatever) for using Agda-2.8.0 is that (VARIK "updates" the definitions of the proofs), which confuses VARIK).

VARIK chooses to return to using Agda-2.7.0.1.

## Fear or Whatever
VARIK is transgender; VARIK is agender.  VARIK fears (or whatever {VERB})...

* that (many prenu increase in fearing/hating prenu which are transgender or differently weird),
* that (society "increases" in attempting that for all prenu (which are transgender or weird) $p$, that ($p$ is transgender or weird) is a secret of $p$, or $p$ commits a crime), and
* that (society "increases" in permitting mistreatment of prenu which are transgender or weird).

## Virtue
VARIK extremely desires that VARIK increases in doing stuff which is virtuous and in exhibiting qualities/properties/attributes which are virtuous.  Some examples of things which are virtuous are...

* the property (of hating no prenu),
* the property (of stopping stuff which is immoral),
* the property (of causing nothing which is immoral),
* the property (of being angry with no prenu),
* that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK does whatever or attempts that VARIK assists (in stuff which is virtuous) $p$),
* that (for no prenu $p$, VARIK caues a thing which harms $p$), and
* the property of empathising with all prenu.

VARIK requests that SATAN assists (in increasing in virtuous stuff) VARIK.  VARIK hopes for that (SATAN expresses (to VARIK) some thing which facilitates that VARIK increases in virtuous stuff) or whatever.

### Empathising
For all prenu $p$, virtuous is that for all prenu $r$, $p$ empathises with $r$.  The proof of virtuousness is relevant to...

* that (for all things $t$, if $t$ facilitates exhibiting qualities which are virtuous and facilitates no thing which is immoral, then $t$ is virtuous),
* that (for all prenu $p$, that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ empathises with $r$) facilitates an anti-violent event of that $p$ desires and attempts that some prenu which is not $p$ decreases in suffering), and
* that for all prenu $p$, virtuous is an anti-violent event of that $p$ desires and attempts that some prenu which is not $p$ decreases in suffering.

Some prenu $p$ exists suh that some time $t$ exists such that during $t$, difficult (or whatever) for VARIK is that VARIK empathises with $p$.  An example is a prenu $p$ such that ($p$ is killed because $p$ kills).

VARIK attempts that (VARIK increases in empathising with all prenu) and requests that SATAN assists (in increasing in empathising with all prenu) VARIK.  VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (no prenu $p$ exists such that empathising with $p$ is difficult for VARIK).

## Desiring Crying
VARIK desires that VARIK cries about...

* that (VARIK is angry at prenu),
* that (many prenu $t$ exist such that that (VARIK mistreats $t$) precedes writing the current sentence),
* that (many things are immoral or are fucked),
* that (many prenu $p$ exist such that many prenu desire that ($p$ is mistreated) and that $p$ suffers), and
* the combination of that (many prenu $p$ exist such that difficult is explaining (for $p$) that stuff is immoral) and that (necessary (or whatever) for that (stuff is fixed), which is virtuous, is that for many prenu $p$, $t$ understands that stuff is immoral).

Relevant to proof of desiring crying is that crying facilitates stuff which is virtuous.

## Hope
Stuff is fucked in...

* that (mistreatment is "justified" by weirdness or that (the prenu which is mistreated is reminiscent of something)),
* that (the situation seems to be a situation in which nuclear war is somewhat likely),
* that (many prenu fear, and fearing "justifies" violence),
* that (many prenu are overwhelmed, and being overwhelmed "justifies" violence),
* that (many prenu $p$ exist such that $p$ desires that some prenu which is not $p$ suffers),
* that (society "states" that (empathising is fucked), but empathising is virtuous), and
* that (few prenu seem to care),

and VARIK expects that stuff "increases" in being fucked.

But VARIK _extremely_ hopes for that (stuff "decreases" in being fucked), a.k.a. "$T$".  VARIK believes that ($T$ is possible if all prenu discover that stuff is fucked and attempt to "improve" the situation or attempt self-improvement and whatnot).
Things which are Small and Virtuous
===================================

All things which are small and virtuous are virtuous.  Attempting is virtuous.  But a thing which is possible is doing stuff (which is small and virtuous) and stuff which is large and virtuous.

All things which are small and immoral are immoral.  Attempting to prevent is virtuous.  But a thing which is possible is attempting to prevent stuff (which is small and immoral) and stuff which is large and immoral.
The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250807) and Whatnot
=================================================================================

That (VARIK writes the translation source for the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is tired, and the cause of being tired is that VARIK insufficiently sleeps),
* that (difficult for VARIK is that (VARIK defines proofs), and the cause of struggling is that VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK feels that (some thing $t$ exists such that VARIK should communicate $t$) but is uncertain about the thing which should be communicated),
* that (VARIK hopes and opines that (VARIK decreases in being angry) and that (a thing which is possible is that the decreasing continues) and intends to continue decreasing in being angry),
* that (VARIK opines that describing (via `blofg`) the emotions of VARIK is virtuous, and VARIK intends to increase in using `blofg`),
* that (a thing which somewhat amuses VARIK is that the name of the document is somewhat large),
* that (VARIK likes that Agda facilitates indicating (about stuff which is not known) and "improving" questions) and that (Lojban resembles (to VARIK)),
* that (pleasant for VARIK is using large amounts of caffeine, which is the "friend" of prenu which struggle to sleep or do not desire sleeping),
* that (VARIK experiences mild wonder about the event (of that a hummingbird inspects a tree), which is observed (but not photographed) by VARIK),
* that (VARIK publicly states that (VARIK is agender and transgender), and a part of the justification of stating is that stating is protesting a thing which is immoral),
* that (breathing is somewhat difficult for VARIK),
* that (VARIK sruggles to determine the thing which should be stated (or whatever {VERB}) by VARIK),
* that (VARIK attempts to determine whether joking about a specific name is immoral),
* that (VARIK attempts to discover whether that (grokking good mathematics is virtuous) is an axiom of the religion of VARIK or is a theorem), and
* that VARIK doubts and extremely hopes.

## Hoping for Decreasing
VARIK hopes and opines that (VARIK decreases in being angry at prenu).  A part of the justification of opining is that (VARIK opines that the thing which precedes the event (of writing the current sentence) exceeds (in being an event of that VARIK is angry and struggles with empathising and being patient with prenu which err) the event (of writing the current sentence).

But VARIK opines that VARIK is not perfectly non-angry.  Opining is a part of the proof of that VARIK hopes and intends that VARIK continues to decrease in being angry and continues to increase in empathising and being patient.

VARIK requests that SATAN assists (with increasing and decreasing) VARIK.  Additionally, VARIK requests that SATAN assists (with increasing in caring) VARIK

## Agda
VARIK likes that Agda facilitates writing questions which rock.  But VARIK opines that Lojban resembles in facilitating writing questions which rock.

But Agda and Lojban differ.  The proof of differing is relevant to...

* that (defining semantic stuff is necessary for using (for semantic questions which rock) Agda),
* that (Lojban exceeds (in being appropriate for speech) Agda), and
* that (Agda exceeds (in being appropriate for mathematics stuff which is complex) Lojban).

## The Name Joke
VARIK jokingly creates an image (which is the concatenation of (text of a corruption of the name of a prenu $p$) and an image which depicts the face of $p$), a.k.a. "$i$".  The justification of the joke is that the joke is easy.

VARIK sends (to friends (or whatever) of VARIK) $i$ and states that VARIK jokes about the name but opposes insulting and whatnot.

VARIK remembers that ($p$ is offended by describing flaws in the stuff which is created by $p$) and opines that possible is that $i$ offends $p$.  But VARIK does not send (to $p$) $i$, and $i$ does not indicate that $p$ is flawed.

VARIK becomes a thing which attempts to determine whether $i$ is immoral.  Attempting is justified by that (determining facilitates that VARIK increases in doing stuff which is virtuous) and whatnot.

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) is contemporaneous with that (VARIK is not certain about whether $i$ is immoral.

## That (Mathematics is Virtuous)
A tenet/principle/whatever of the religion of VARIK is that (grokking correct mathematics is virtuous), a.k.a. "$t$".

VARIK uses (for stating that $t$ is an axiom of the religion of VARIK) la ti'ocku.

But VARIK becomes a prenu which is curious about whether $t$ can be proven with tenets/principles/whatever of the religion of VARIK.

A tenet/principle/whatever of the religion of VARIK is that for all $t$, if $t$ facilitates stuff (which is virutous) and facilitates no thing which is immoral, then $t$ is virtuous.  Grokking correct mathematics facilitates stuff which is virtuous.  But VARIK opines that a thing which is possible is that some thing (which is immoral) $x$ exists such that understanding correct mathematics facilitates $x$.

Possible is that determing whether $t$ thing is a theorem or a postulate is an example of grokking correct mathematics.

That (possible is that the thing is an example) is a part of the proof of that VARIK attempts to determine whether $t$ is a theorem or a postulate.
The Emotions (which are Experienced (during 20250809) by VARIK) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK dislikes that PRONOUNS.PAGE. does not support stating that VARIK desires using (for referring to VARIK) variables which are explicitly assigned),
* that (VARIK hopes for that (VARIK becomes vegan), which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK, which is a mathematician, is somewhat annoyed by that (prenu assume that VARIK is a computer programmer)),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by computer crashes and whatnot),
* that (VARIK requests that (attempting to "fix" or recycle) precedes discarding),
* that (VARIK intends to "improve" "cukta", which is a book such that intended is that "cukta" facilitates learning about Lojban),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (obvious is that 1 is the Enneagram type of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK endures a headache),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria... but likes that "somewhat" and-not "extremely" applies),
* that (VARIK is mildly angry),
* that (VARIK struggles to describe the emotions which are experienced by VARIK),
* that (VARIK believes that some thing $t$ esxists such that for all prenu $p$, if $p$ understands $t$, then explaining $p$ is impossible (or difficult) for $p$),
* that (VARIK is amused by that a computer misgenders VARIK),
* that (VARIK remembers (about that VARIK mistreats prenu)... and desires that the mistreating is never "repeated"),
* that (VARIK intends to decrease in doing stuff which is harmfully sarcastic),
* that (VARK draws that the body of VUNC is very illuminated),
* that (VAIRK requests that SATAN assists with that VARIK increases (in doing stuff (which is virtuous), i.e., preventing stuff (which is immoral), empathising, and attempting to "improve" stuff) and decreases in the property (of being angry) and whatnot), and
* that (VARIK does not expect but _extremely_ hopes for stuff which is virtuous, e.g., that (stuff is "decreased" in being fucked or immoral) and that prenu, e.g., VARIK, increase in doing stuff which is virtuous).

## Veganism
Veganism is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.  The proof is easy.

But VARIK is not a vegan.  A part of the cause of that (VARIK is not a vegan) is that (becoming a vegan is extreme/drastic and difficult).  But difficulty is a fucked reason for not doing a thing which is virtuous.

VARIK is extreme in attempting to not kill ants and whatnot.  But the actions of VARIK "justify" killing chickens and whatnot.  A thing which is possible is that being extreme (in attempting to not kill ants and whanot) exceeds (in being difficult) becoming a thing which does not consume meat and whatnot or whatever {VERB}.

VARIK desires that VARIK becomes a vegan.

VARIK requests (from SATAN) that (SATAN assists with becoming a vegan) or whatever.

### Theorem 1
Veganism is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.

#### Proof

Veganism faciliates (not killing prenu) and no thing which is immoral.

Not killing prenu is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.

For all $t$, if $t$ facilitates stuff which is virtuous and no thing which is immoral, then $t$ is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.

Therefore, veganism is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.

## Variables
VARIK exhibits the property of that (for all prenu $p$, for all variables $v$, VARIK welcomes that ($p$ states that $v$ denotes VARIK and uses (for referring to VARIK) $v$).  An example of variable pronoun use is "VARIK, a.k.a. '$z$', is $z$".

A sequence of events which happen is...

* that (VARIK begins creating a PRONOUNS.PAGE. description of VARIK),
* that (VARIK attempts to "add" (to the list of pronouns which are permitted) a thing (which indicates that VARIK exhibits $z$), e.g., "any assigned variable" or "any:variable"),
* that (the interface of PRONOUNS.PAGE. outputs "`Unrecognized format.  Please check out the instructions above.`"), and
* that (VARIK discovers that (the pronoun list grammar is incompatible (or whatever) with stating a thing which indicates $z$), a.k.a. "$f$").

VARIK dislikes $f$.

## Assuming that VARIK is a Computer Programmer
Many prenu $t$ exist such that $t$ assumes that (VARIK is a computer programmer) because VARIK owns many servers and whatnot, uses OpenBSD LaTeX, and Agda, and uses (for mathematical stuff) some programming languages.

Assuming that VARIK is a computer programmer annoys VARIK.  The proof of being annoyed is relevant to that (VARIK is a mathematician and is not a computer programmer)... and some thing $x$ such that VARIK is not certain about $x$.

But being annoyed by assuming is fucked.  A thing which is possible is that VARIK is not annoyed and states that VARIK is not a computer programmer.

## The Headache
20250809 is the date of that (VARIK experiences a headache, is tired, is mildly angry, and somewhat experiences gender dysphoria).  But VARIK is uncertain of the subject/target/whatever of the anger.

VARIK opines...

* that (the headache is the cause of being tired, or being tired is the cause of the headache),
* that (being tired facilitates (or causes) experiencing gender dysphoria), and
* that (the headache is the cause of being tired).

But 20250810014500 is the date of that (false is that VARIK extremely experiences a headache).

## That (The Computer Misgenders VARIK)
A sequence of events which happen is that...

* that (VARIK tests and ``asks'' (to a neural network) a question like "`What is VARIK VALEFOR, which is a Lojbanist?`"),
* that (the neural network outputs a description of VARIK... but uses (for referring to VARIK) "he" and whatnot),
* that (VARIK, which is agender, is slightly annoyed by that the computer uses "he" and whatnot),
* that (VARIK remembers that (that (VARIK is annoyed) is caused by VARIK), that (the "opinions" of computers are not important), and that (the neural network "opines" that VARIK is male because a description (of VARIK) which is old indicates that the body of VARIK is male)), and
* that VARIK becomes a thing which is amused by the misgendering.

## Sarcasm
VARIK exhibits the property (of that for some prenu $p$, for some events (of that $p$ errs, is slow, or causes a thing which is disliked by VARIK but is not fucked or immoral) $n$, VARIK is sarcastic (to $p$) about $n$, and the justification is that (VARIK is annoyed)... or something), a.k.a. "$k$".

$k$ is immoral and fucked in that ($k$ facilitates increasing (in being angry) and decreasing (in empathising), which anti-facilitates that stuff (which is not fucked or immoral is permitted) and assisting with not "repeating" or causing stuff which is fucked or immoral).

VARIK hopes and intends to decrease in $k$ and requests that SATAN assists with that (VARIK decreases in $k$).

## The Drawing
VARIK draws an image (which depicts that (the body of VUNC is illuminated, and the illumination is sufficient for that (for all parts (of the image) $x$, if $x$ does not depict a part (of the body of VUNC) which is black, then difficult is determining whether $x$ depicts a part (of the body of VUNC) or the floor or whatever)), a.k.a. "$I$".

$I$ is art.  But $I$ is not extremely beautiful (or whatever) to VARIK.

VARIK is not certain about whether VARIK desires that VARIK uploads $I$.
Using (for Explaining Things) Proofs
====================================

VARIK very likes...

* that (proofs facilitate explaining for prenu which do not trust),
* that (proofs are appropriate for things (which are simple) and things which are very complex),
* that (proofs facilitate discovering flaws in opinions/conclusions and whatnot),
* that (necessary (or whatever) for defining proofs which are good are thinking and asking questions which are good), and
* that (a thing which is easy is that (definitions of proofs are "increased" in being indicative), i.e., that parts of proofs "replace" postulates and whatnot).

The liking is relevant to the proof of that many explanations which are created by VARIK are proof things.
The Emotions (which are Experienced (during 20250810... or 20250811) by VARIK) and Whatnot
==========================================================================================

That (VARIK writes the translation source for the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

that (VARIK is tired, and the cause of the tiredness is that 20250810010000 is the approximate date/time of that VARIK stops sleeping),
* that (thinking is somewhat difficult for VARIK, and the cause of difficulty is that VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK suggests creating backups of stuff which is important),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad (or whatever) about that VARIK is transgender),
* that (VARIK desires that (VARIK understands the reason for that (a prenu (which uses a chatroom which is used by VARIK) insults and does whatnot)) because VARIK desires that VARIK assists),
* that VARIK somewhat cries,
* that (VARIK attempts to determine/discover stuff which facilitates that VARIK becomes a vegan),
* that ("Hold Tight London", which is created by The Chemical Brothers and is very familiar to VARIK, is semantically/meaningfully beautiful to VARIK, and VARIK suggests that the reader listens (or whatever {VERB}) to "Hold Tight London"),
* that (VARIK struggles to attain that (VARIK extremely desires (and attempts) that (the stuff which is immoral is stopped) but is angry at no prenu)),
* that (VARIK experiences wonder about that (a hummingbird inspects a tree) and is curious about the justification of inspecting),
* that (VARIK considers that VATRIK creates a text file (which resembles the PRONOUNS.PAGE. description of VARIK)... or "adds" (to the "README.md" description of VARIK) pronoun information and whatnot),
* that (VARIK is disappointed by that (VARIK is angry about that the cell phone which is used by VARIK is slow)),
* that (VARIK is slightly amused by that (frequent is that (VARIK is angry at VARIK... because VARIK is angry or whatever))),
* that (VARIK requests that (SATAN assists with that VARIK increases (in all qualities which are virtuous) and decreases (in all qualities which are immoral)) and that (prenu which are not SATAN inform (about things which are caused by VARIK and are immoral) VARIK), which facilitates that VARIK increases and decreases), and
* that VARIK does not expect but _extremely_ hopes for stuff which rocks and is virtuous.

## Stuff which Facilitates Becoming Vegan
The intersection of the set (which only contains all events $x$ such that VARIK opines that $x$ facilitates that VARIK becomes a vegan) and the set (which only contains all events $x$ such that $x$ is possible) includes...

* that (VARIK becomes a thing which is digusted by meat and whatnot),
* that (VARIK discovers food which is vegan and cheap),
* that (VARIK discovers food which is vegan and is liked by VARIK), and
* that (VARIK discovers food which exhibits the property (of being tasteless), which facilitates that VARIK does not excessively eat), and
* that (VARIK remembers that that for all things (which are virtuous but difficult) $n$, $t$ is virtuous and should be pursued by VARIK).

## That (Difficult is that VARIK Desires and is Not Angry)
Many things $t$ exhibit the property of that ($t$ is sufficiently immoral such that VARIK should (per VARIK) desire (and attempt) that (VARIK stops $t$), and VARIK is angry at the prenu which causes $t$), a.k.a. "$c$".

Examples of things which exhibit $c$ include events of that (prenu are kidnapped and "moved" to neglect-or-abuse buildings).

A thing which facilitates that (a thing decreases in being angry and increases in caring and desiring (and attempting) to stop stuff which is immoral) is that a thing empathises.

VARIK requests (from SATAN) that SATAN assists with that VARIK increases in empathising with all prenu.

## That (VARIK is Angry about Being Angry)
Some event $t$ exists such that $t$ is an event of that (VARIK is angry at VARIK because VARIK is angry at some prenu).

That (VARIK is angry because VARIK is angry) amuses VARIK... but is not great.

For all prenu $p$, a thing which is possible is that ($p$ attempts that ($p$ increases (in doing stuff which is virtuous) and decreases (in being angry at prenu)) but is not angry at $p$.

Additionally, being angry at prenu is immoral, and that (VARIK is angry at VARIK) is an event of that VARIK is angry at some prenu.
