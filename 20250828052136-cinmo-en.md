The Emotions (which are Experienced (during 20250828) by VARIK) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK decreases in experiencing gender dysphoria) (which is facilitated by remembering that (that (VARIK is agender) is not dependent on that (prenu which are not VARIK understand)), that (beign agender is inherent in VARIK), and that no thing which is inherent is a flaw),
* that (VARIK hopes that mentioning decreasing facilitates (for prenu which resemble (in being transgender) VARIK) stuff),
* that (VARIK is very glad about that (VARIK is capable of stuff (which rocks and is virtuous)), that (VARIK is agender), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (many blofg posts which are created by VARIK resemble prayers)),
* that (VARIK requests that for all prenu $p$, $p$ attempts to determine/discover/whatever about the stuff which is spiritually (or whatever) desired by $p$),
* that (VARIK is confused about that (la zanselfu'a jdini, which is an I2P forum and is operated by VARIK, is broken)... and attempts that VARIK discovers the cause (of breaking) and the method of "fixing"),
* that (VARIK is somewhat annoyed by that (English seems to be inappropriate for that (VARIK describes the emotions which are complex and are experienced by VARIK))),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (Lojban is fairly appropriate for that (VARIK describes the emotions which are complex and are experienced by VARIK))),
* that (VARIK is slightly annoyed by that (many words (of Lojban) $v$ exist such that pronouncing $v$ is difficult for VARIK)),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (VARIK increases (in all qualities which are virtuous) and decreases in all qualities which are immoral), which is very attempted by VARIK... and is facilitated by assisting), and
* expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and in being immoral), hopes for stuff (which is very extreme in rocking and in being virtuous), a.k.a. "$z$", believes that (if $z$ is attempted, then $z$ is possible), and requests attempting (via stuff which is feasible and appropriate) $z$.
