# Events of that Experts Teach
Easy for experts is forgetting about the experience of not being an expert.

The easiness is a part of a proof of that many prenu which teach are not experts.

That (many prenu which teach are not experts) annoys VARIK.  VARIK requests that experts attempt that easy is using (for increasing in competence) the stuff which is done by experts.

A thing which is easy is assuming that things are obvious for all prenu.  Regardless of whether VARIK is an expert, the easiness is familiar to VARIK; a thing which is frequent is that (VARIK explains things, but the explanations are small and are suitable for experts... and-not whatnot).
