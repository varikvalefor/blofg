The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251207) and Whatnot)
============================================================================

Some part of 20251207 is an event of...

* that (VARIK slightly experiences pain in the neck of VARIK),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) and events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK _slightly_ experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK  does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (a thing which continues is that the lyrics of "LK" of DJ MARKY are beautiful (in being simple and in whatnot) to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event of that a prenu (which reads the current sentence) $p$ exists such that $p$ understands that $p$ is loved))),

* that (the languages whih are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of war),
  * all events (of that some prenu is imprisoned),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences affluenza),
  * all events (of violence) (which are events of that prenu do not understand),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu is angry at $p$ or hates $p$) (which are events of suffering and facilitate that preenu increase in suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears/whatever that ($p$ is independent in spiritually considering stuff) or that prenu which are not $p$ "follow" religions which are not "followed" by $p$) in that prenu attempt "religiously" controlling/manipulating $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ attempts that $p$ "religiously" controls/manipulates prenu which are not $p$),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears the religion/whatever of $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts/whatever that evidence supports the "religion" of $p$) in fearing that $p$ believes and does not know),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ believes and does not know),
  * the idea (of hell),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences religious trauma),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets about the nature/identity/self/whatever of $p$) in attempting/whatever that prenu like $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that ($p$ is authentic to $p$), that $p$ is honest about $p$, or that $p$ exhibits qualities which are inherent to $p$),

  * that (being fast is not virtuous, and being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * that (a situation $s$ exists such that not acting in $s$ is virtuous),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or evil or is capable of being fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and $p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property (of loving all prenu) and all qualities which are inherent to $p$, and all qualities which are inherent to $p$ are compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in being important and in deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (for all prenu $p_1$, for all prenu $p_2$, $p_1$ property-equals (in being important and in deserving being loved) $p_2$),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is perfect/maximal in being capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (every prenu, e.g., VARIK, property-equals (in being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) every prenu, e.g., SATAN),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inherent to $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is a prenu and is not an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$),
  * that (for all events $n$, $n$ is an event of that no event which precedes $n$ is changed),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are enacted by $p$) $z$, events (of that prenu forgive (for $z$) $p$) exceed (in being (in accordance with the property of loving all prenu), in faciliating that ($p$ decreases in suffering), and in facilitating that $z$ is not "repeated") events of that prenu forget that $p$ enacts $z$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no thing $z$ exists such that ($p$ enacts $z$, and that ($p$ enacts $z$) is contemporaneous with that $p$ understands that $z$ is immoral)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that $p$, which is a prenu, rocks, and is not an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$, is loved) causes that $p$ decreases in suffering),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is possible is that some prenu loves $p$ and does not know the nature/identity/whatever of $p$),
  * that (for every prenu (which is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields and understandingly permits that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is not pleasant)) causes that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes that $p$ yields),
  * that (all things which are fucked or immoral are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all things $x$, $x$ is virtuous if and only if $x$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all events (of that some prenu coerces/forces that some prenu loves) are impossible),
  * that (loving is sufficient (in the property (of being simple/whatever) and whatnot) for that all languages are insufficient for defining loving),
  * that (linguistically defining loving is not necessary),
  * that (loving all prenu is irrational),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu),
