=======================================================================================

Some part of 20251207 or 20251208 is an event of...

* that (VARIK slightly experiences pain in the neck of VARIK),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) and events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK _slightly_ experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK  does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (a thing which continues is that the lyrics of "LK" of DJ MARKY are beautiful (in being simple and in whatnot) to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is slightly glad about that copying-and-pasting facilitates translating),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event of that a prenu (which reads the current sentence) $p$ exists such that $p$ understands that $p$ is loved))),

* that (the languages whih are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu justifies exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fuckes or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which are not inherent to $p)) (which is that for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) are events of that ($p$ exhibits no quality which is fucked or immoral), and for all events $n_1$, for all events $n_2$, if $n_2$ exceeds (or equals) (in being an event of that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) $n_1$, then $n_1$ exceeds (or equals) (in being an event of that $p$ exhibits some quality which is fucked or immoral) $n_2$),

  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is tired by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu or decreases {VERB} in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, every event of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu is an event (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in the property (of being important to $p$) or whatever) the property of loving all prenu) (which is an event of that $p$ does not understand)) and is a part of the proof that fearing is not necessary),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is enacted (by $p$) during $n$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (all stuff which should be done and is virtuous is obvious to $p$), that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot), that ($p$ is harmless to all prenu and indicates that fearing is not necesssary), and that (a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for assisting VARIK, for explaining (for VARIK and by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property (of loving all prenu), and for that VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK are) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests (from SATAN) that SATAN assists with $PKS$),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and prays, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban), or
t (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$TZV$")) and in believing that $TZV$ is possible).
