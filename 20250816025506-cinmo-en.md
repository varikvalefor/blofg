The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250816) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK does not very experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is somewhat angry at VARIK, and the "justifications" of being angry are that (VARIK is angry at prenu) and that VARIK sleeps excessively),
* that (VARIK experiences discomfort/pain/whatever about that (that (VARIK watches the flashgun) is contemporaneous with that (the flashgun is very used))),
* that (VARIK is somewhat amused by the flashgun pain event),
* that (VARIK is amused (but annoyed whatever) by that (the input of a neural network is a document (which indicates that VARIK welcomes that "IT" (of English) is a pronoun of VARIK), and the output of the neural network is a document $t$ such that within $t$, "HE" is used as a pronoun of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK suggests attempting "fixing" stuff which is broken such that attempting "fixing" is not dangerous),
* that (VARIK considers that VARIK draws a thing which depicts that (VUNC holds a glass (which contains caffeine liquid which is yellow) and says ".i mo  .i pinca si se pinxe jenai cu co'e" or something)),
* that (VARIK requests that all prenu remember that (stuff which sucks or is immoral is unnecessary), that (stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible), and that erring does not prevent attempting stuff which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK hopes and somewhat opines that VARIK begins becoming a thing which is disgusted by meat and whatnot),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that VARIK increases in all qualities (which are virtuous), decreases (in all qualities which are immoral), and discovers a thing which should be done and facilitates that VARIK assists all prenu),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain/discomfort/whatever about that VARIK is uncertain about the thing which should be done),
* that (VARIK expects stuff which is very fucked and is very immoral, but VARIK _extremely_ hopes for stuff which is extreme in being virtuous and in rocking, and VARIK opines that stuff which is extreme in being virtuous and in rocking is possible).

## The Flashgun
A sequence of events which happen is...

* that (VARIK attempts to use (with a camera which is used by VARIK) a flashgun),
* that (VARIK discovers that the flashgun does not emit the red light which facilitates automatic focusing),
* that (VARIK attempts that VARIK configures the camera such that the flashgun appropriately emits the red light),
* that (VARIK attempts (by watching the flashgun and activating the focus/photograph button) to determine whether VARIK successfully configures the camera),
* that (VARIK errs in completely activating the photograph button and sees the part of the flashgun which is very illuminated, and the extreme light causes that VARIK experiences eye pain), and
* that VARIK becomes a thing (which is amused by the pain and erring)... and a thing which desires that the error is not "repeated".

## That ("Fixing" is Requested or Suggested)
For all prenu $p$, for all things (which are owned by $p$) $s$, if $p$ opines that $s$ is broken, then if attempting to "fix" $s$ is not dangerous, then VARIK requests (or suggests) that that ($p$ attempts "fixing" $s$ or gives (to a prenu which is willing) $s$) precedes that $p$ gives (to a landfill or something) $s$.

Justifications include...

* that (attempting to "fix" stuff facilitates "fixing" stuff, and "fixing" stuff is virtuous in preventing giving (to landfills) and wasting things),
* that (attempting to "fix" stuff facilitates discovering causes (of breakage), which facilitates preventing breakage), and
* that (many things (which are broken) $s$ exist such that "fixing" $s$ exceeds (in being cheap and in being easy) "replacing" $s$).

## Meat
VARIK somewhat opines that VARIK becomes a thing which is disgusted by the idea of that (VARIK eats meat or whatever).  Reasons for opining include that (that (VARIK is somewhat disgusted) is contemporaneous with that (VARIK inspects the meat which is contained by the refrigerator which is used by VARIK)) and that (20250816 is the date of that (VARIK eats cheese) and that (VARIK does not very enjoy eating the cheese)).

VARIK hopes for that (the opinion is true) and that (VARIK increases in being appropriately disgusted by meat), which facilitates that (VARIK becomes a vegan), which is virtuous.

## Stuff which is Requested by VARIK
For all prenu $p$, VARIK requests that $p$ remembers...

* that (no thing which is immoral or fucked is necessary),
* that (stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible), and
* that (for all prenu $x$, for any thing (which is immoral, is caused by $x$, and does not kill $x$) $g$, false is that ($g$ causes that $x$ is capable of no thing which rocks and is virtuous)).
