The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251227) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251227 is an event of...

* that (the milligramme-based amount of caffeine which is consumed by VARIK approximately equals 480),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender, and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about event of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent, is gentle, and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),

* that (VARIK is not excited about the process of translating (to English) the translation source of the current sentence),
* that (VARIK plays with MilkyTracker and is reminded about that music stuff is difficult for VARIK),

* that (VARIK is not annoyed),
* that (VARIK somewhat desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event of that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ remembers about the property of loving all prenu, loves $p$, and understands that $p$ is loved)))),
