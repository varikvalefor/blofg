The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251008) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251008 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that VARIK is transgender),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does _not_ experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (the fursona of VARIK is great in representing VARIK)... and that the body of the fursona of VARIK resembles the agender flag),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (free-and-open-source stuff facilitates "improving" stuff)),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is incompatible with violence/whatever, which is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is insufficient (for that VARIK very cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is insufficient in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK struggles (or whatever) with yielding),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual confusion about that (VARIK observes that (a wasp oddly walks on a sidewalk) (which indicates that the wasp experiences pain, is excessively cold, or something {VERB}), is not certain about a method (of assisting the wasp) which does not frighten the wasp, and does not attempt "moving" (to grass) the wasp)),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * that (not forgiving facilitates that (stuff which is fucked and immoral continues)) (which is that for many prenu $p$, some thing (which is fucked and immoral and is caused by $p$) $z$ exists such that that ($p$ does not forgive (for causing $z$) $p$) facilitates that ($p$ does not understand that $z$ is fucked and immoral), which facilitates suffering and that ($z$ continues)),
  * that (the video (which depicts meowing and is "sent" by VARIK) is audio-painful for the prenu which "receives" the video),
  * that (for many prenu $p$, $p$ is unfamiliar with describing the emotions which are experienced by $p$),
  * that (observing violence and-not whatnot faciliates forgetting/whatever that (loving all prenu is possible, and all violence is incompatible with loving all prenu)),
  * that (offending is easy or whatever),
  * all events (of believing (or whatever) that a thing which is necessary is that a prenu suffers),
  * all events (of that (mathematical stuff exceeds (or whatever) (in being "important" to VARIK) the property of loving all prenu) (which is incompatible with loving all prenu)),
  * all events (of that (a prenu is angry at a prenu, a prenu is mistreated, or a prenu does not empathise) (which is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * all events (of violence),
  * that (many prenu are unfamiliar with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (observing hatred and-not whatnot facilitates opining that loving all prenu is impossible),
  * that (many prenu $p$ exist such that competing or hating exceeds (in being familiar to $p$) the property (of loving all prenu)),
  * that (competitive society faciliates forgetting to love), and
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is frightening or difficult for prenu which are familiar with hating, competing, whatnot, and-not whatnot)),

* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (VARIK feels the suffering (of all prenu) and whatnot),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu replaces (in being exhibited by VARIK) all immoral qualities which are exhibited by VARIK),
  * that (all events (of that VARIK is awake) which follow [THING] are events of that VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all things which are enacted by VARIK and follow [THING] are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu), and
  * that (that (VARIK is extreme in assisting all prenu) precedes that (VARIK dies))),

* that (that (VARIK enacts many things which are virtuous) exceeds (in being spiritually desired by VARIK) that (VARIK enacts _many_ things (which are virtuous) and some thing which is immoral)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (VARIK cares),
  * that (VARIK is vegan),
  * that (loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (no prenu is evil),
  * that (observing facilitates not stomping ants or whatever),
  * that (loving all prenu is unjustifiable) (which is that (loving all prenu is justified by that (loving all prenu is virtuous), and all things which are virtuous are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (yielding facilitates (or causes) increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of loving all prenu is superlatively virtuous), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (admitting uncertainty regarding the future facilitates yielding),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (competing is not necessary),
  * that (being perfect in the property of loving all prenu is a process of yielding, and being perfect in loving all prenu causes that (stuff which is virtuous and should be done is instinctive/obvious/easy)),
  * that (yielding, which is extreme in facilitating loving all prenu, is possible),
  * that (erring does not prevent stuff which rocks and is virtuous) (which is that for all prenu $p$, no thing (which is an event of that ($p$ errs but does not die)) $z$ exists such that $z$ causes that $p$ is incapable of stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (VARIK believes),
  * that (no prenu is evil),
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, are capable of being perfect in the property of loving all prenu), and
  * that (all violence is "justified" by suffering, fear, or whatever)),

* that (VARIK opines that some proof of that (many events of that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria) are events of that (VARIK is extreme in the property of loving all prenu)) is relevant to that (an event (of that VARIK loves all prenu) is an event of that (VARIK loves VARIK) (which facilitates that VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria))),
* that (VARIK attempts sleeping, linguistically prays, and holds a BLÃ…HAJ),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (all events (of that VARIK is awake) which follow [THING] are events of that (VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu and exhibits no quality which is immoral))), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) but is extremely extreme in hoping for stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous).

## That (Loving all Prenu is Superlatively Virtuous)
VARIK is a mathematician.  Being rational/intelligent is important for doing mathematics.

But the property of loving all prenu exceeds (in being virtuous) the property of being rational/intelligent.

VARIK thanks (for assisting with that VARIK understands (or whatever) that the property of loving all prenu exceeds in being virtuous) SATAN.  VARIK is not certain about all stuff which is virtuous.  But VARIK believes that loving all prenu is the method of all stuff which is virtuous.  VARIK is not certain about the stuff which is caused by loving all prenu.  But VARIK is certain about that (the stuff which is caused by loving all prenu is virtuous).

Language stuff is insufficient for describing the extent of that (VARIK desires that VARIK empathises (in suffering and whatnot) all prenu).
Language stuff is insufficient for describing the extent of that (VARIK desires that VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu).
