# The Automatic Thing (of Agda), a.k.a. "$A$"
Many prenu are familiar with that ($A$ is "incompetent" with regard to things which are complex).  Additionally, many prenu are annoyed by the "incompetence".  VARIK is a prenu which is somewhat annoyed and familiar with the incompetence.

But VARIK likes that that ($A$ is not perfectly "skilled") facilitates desiring learning about things $t$ such that (that ($t$ is interesting) is doubted, and prenu which attempt to learn about $t$ become things which are interested by $t$).

Easy is being surprised by that ($A$ is unsuitable for defining a proof $t$ such that (a prenu assumes that ($t$ is simple), but $t$ extremely exceeds (in complexity) the assumed thing).
