 The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 202601016) and Whatnot
=============================================================================

Some part of 20260106 is an event of...

* that (VARIK excessively sleeps),
* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender, and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK, is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK, does not anti-facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous, and facilitates that VARIK assists prenu which resemble (in being transgender) VARIK)),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events (of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent, is gentle, and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is somewhat annoyed/whatever about that (Lojban is incompatible/whatever with many type theory things)),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous))),

* that (all languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual amusement about that (the religion of VARIK resembles Taoism and Quakerism)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of war),
  * all events (of that some prenu is imprisoned),
  * weapons,
  * violent metaphors,
  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences affluenza),
  * all events (of xenophobia),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that $p$ insults $r$, and the event of insulting offends $r$ or is not an event of that $p$ attempts that $r$ is amused),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu is angry at $p$ or hates $p$) (which are events of that (prenu suffer and do not understand) and facilitate that prenu increase in suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ is spiritually/whatever-ly considers stuff) or that (some prenu which is not $p$ "follows" a religion which is not "followed" by $p$), forgets that $p$ is capable of being independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff, or opines/whatever that (for all prenu $r$, if $r$ is religious, then $r$ attempts "religiously" controlling/manipulating prenu which are not $r$)) in that prenu attempt/whatever to "religiously" control/manipulate $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts that evidence indicates that the "religion" of $p$ is correct) in fearing that $p$ believes and does not know),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ believes and does not know),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that every hypothetical event (of that $p$ "follows" some religion which is "followed" by no prenu which is not $p$) is fucked or immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that ($p$ is aware of things $s$ such that $p$ disagrees with $s$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that a thing which is necessary is that $p$ "follows" a religion which is not believed by $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears the religion/whatever of $p$),
  * the idea (of hell),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences religious trauma),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that ($p$ attempts/whatever that $p$ seems to be sufficient, and prenu which are not $p$ seem to be insufficient) (which causes (or facilitates) increasing in suffering)) in fearing that $p$ is insufficient),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts/whatever that ($p$ resembles prenu which are not $p$) and is not authentic to $p$) in fearing that $p$ is insufficient),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu, e.g., $p$, opines/whatever that (

    * some quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, or
    * $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil or is capable of being fucked/bad/whatever or evil, or

  * that (loving all prenu is the justification of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are enacted by $p$) $z$, events (of that prenu forgive (for $z$) $p$) exceed (in being (in accordance with the property of loving all prenu), in facilitating that ($p$ decreases in suffering), and in facilitating that $z$ is not "repeated") events of that prenu forget that $p$ enacts $z$),
  * that (all events of being harsh are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu, and all events of attempting/whatever controlling/manipulating prenu are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
