===========================================================================
Some event of that VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK experiences a headache or something),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (a thing which is possible is that a thing $t$ exists such that $t$ experiences a headache and is not certain about whether $t$ experiences a headache)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in causing tyops),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria), that (VARIK very empathises with prenu which exceed (in experiencing gender dysphoria) VARIK), that (VARIK considers that being transgender, which is not immoral, is not a flaw),
* that (VARIK is glad about being agender, which is inherent to VARIK and facilitates that VARIK assists prenu which resemble (in being transgender) VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that things which differ and interest, e.g., birds and insects, exist),
* that (VARIK experiences mild [COMPLAINT EMOTION] about that (necessary (or whatever) is that (VARIK "deletes" photographs which suck), and VARIK is slow in "deleting" photographs which suck)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences wonder about that (the hexadecimal representation of the SHA256 hash of a photograph file is "matched" by `\d{16}`)),
* that (VARIK intends to develop the photograph (which depicts the buckeye, which is a butterfly) and the photograph which depicts the sulphur, which is a butterfly)
* that (VARIK hopes for that the photographs which are created by VARIK facilitate caring (about things which are not human), which is difficult for many prenu),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about many things (which are fucked and immoral), e.g., things (which are caused by VARIK) and things which are not caused by VARIK),
* that (VARIK hopes and requests that all prenu attempt (via anti-violence) preventing stuff which is fucked and immoral, e.g., things (which are large) and things which are small)
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain and feels that VARIK is insufficient in doing stuff which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK attempts discovering about $\{x : \left(\textrm{VARIK IS CAPABLE OF}\ x\right) \land \left(x\ \textrm{IS VIRTUOUS}\right) \land \left(x\ \textrm{PREVENTS STUFF WHICH IS FUCKED AND IMMORAL}\right)\}),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about that (prenu obey requests which are immoral)),
* that (VARIK admits that hoping is difficult), that (VARIK opines that a thing which facilitates the stuff which is hoped by VARIK is that many prenu believe that the stuff is possible, hope for the stuff, and attempt the stuff), that (VARIK opines that considering that hoping facilitates facilitates hoping),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (VARIK increases in all qualities (which are virtuous), e.g., the quality (of empathising with all prenu), the quality (of empathetically doing things which are virtuous), and the quality of assisting (with stuff which is virtuous) prenu, and decreases in all qualities (which are immoral), e.g., being angry at prenu)), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is fucked and immoral), extremely hopes for stuff (which is extreme in being virtuous and rocking), a.k.a. "$Z$", and believes that ($Z$, is possible, but attempting is necessary for $Z$)).

## Experiencing a Headache
20250905163100 is the date of...

* that (VARIK experiences a headache or something and is not certain about the headache),
* that (VARIK is tired, experiences gender dysphoria, and is extreme in causing tpyos),
* that (VARIK is amused by that a thing which is possible is that VARIK experiences a headache and is not certain about whether VARIK experiences a headache),
* that (VARIK suspects that experiencing the headache or whatever causes (or whatever) experiencing gender dysphoria and whatnot), and
* that (VARIK hopes for decreasing (in experiencing a headache or whatever), which facilitates that VARIK increases in doing stuff which is virtuous).

20250906 resembles (in being a date of an event of that VARIK is tired, experiences a headache or something, and experiences gender dysphoria) 20250905.  But 20250906 exceeds (in being a date of an event of that VARIK is glad about being agender) 20250905.

Additionally, 20250906 is the date of the event of that VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that VARIK decreases (in experiencing a headache or whatever), which facilitates stuff which is virtuous.

## Experiencing Gender Dysphoria
Frequent is that a thing (which facilitates that VARIK decreases in experiencing gender dysphoria) is that VARIK thinks about...

* proofs (of that being transgender is not a flaw) (which include the thing (which is relevant to that (the thing is not immoral)) and the thing which is relevant to that (the thing is inherent)),
* that (the cause of gender dysphoria is that (many prenu mistreat prenu which are transgender) and-not that (VARIK is transgender), which is true), and
* [TRANSLATION???].

For some prenu $p$ which feels that some thing is a flaw of $p$, feeling that all qualities of $p$ are flaws is easy for $p$.  But false is that a prenu $p$ exists such that a thing which is inherent in $p$ is a flaw of $p$.

## The Hash
The hexadecimal representation of the SHA256 hash of a photograph which is created by VARIK is "855aa0d2a23983ce12cbcfc0dbc5e37285da1cbd1dc31c7e0850222388481425".

VARIK is slightly surprised by the hash.  A thing which is infrequent is that the hexadecimal representation of a SHA256 hash is regular-expression-matched by `\d{16}`.

VARIK admits that the thing is not extremely important.
