===========================================================================

Some part of 20251006 or 20251007 is an event of...

* that (VARIK slightly experiences a headache),
* that (VARIK does not experience a headache),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK knows that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) and that VARIK knows that VARIK is transgender),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is slightly angry at VARIK, and the "justification" is that VARIK is angry)
* that (VARIK intends to protect and assist all prenu),
* that (VARIK is fuckedly excessive in feeling defensively),
* that (VARIK is fuckedly insufficient in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that VARIK is insufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient for loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (the Blofg of VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous, e.g., that (a prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ forgives $p$)),
  * that (all things which are enacted by VARIK and are preceded by [THING] are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK experiences/feels the suffering of all prenu) (which is that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK experiences the suffering of $p$), is unpleasant, and is in accordance with loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu), and
  * whatnot),

* that (language stuff is insufficient for describing the extent of that VARIK desires that (VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu) (which is an event of yielding and being angry at no prenu)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of that a prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is hated, is mistreated, or is despaired),
  * that (competitive society facilitates forgetting (about the property of loving all prenu) and that (loving all prenu scares/frightens the prenu which are members of the society)),
  * that (observing that prenu are unfamiliar with the property of loving all prenu facilitates opining that loving all prenu is impossible),
  * that (many prenu seem to desire violence or whatever),
  * that (many prenu are familiar with violence and-not whatnot),
  * all events (of that VARIK is fuckedly insufficient in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is easy-difficult) (which is that the property (of loving all prenu), which is a yielding thing, is "difficult" for prenu which are familiar with competing and-not whatnot),
  * that (loving all prenu frightens many preu which are not familiar with the property of loving all prenu), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (jungle music faciliates yielding, which faciliates increasing in the property of loving all prenu) and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (that (VARIK yields) precedes that (VARIK exhibits the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (many things which amuse facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (events of loving all prenu are events of yielding),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is perfect in the property of loving all prenu) are events (of that the stuff (which should be done) (which rocks and is virtuous) is obvious to $p$)),
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, are (regardless of remembering/forgetting) capable of being perfect in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, assists VARIK),
  * that (no prenu is evil),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no thing $z$ exists such that that ($p$ enacts $z$) is contemporaneous with that ($p$ understands that $z$ is immoral)),
  * that (for all things (which are violent) $v$, for all prenu (which cause $v$) $p$, the justification (of that $p$ causes $v$) is relevant to that ($p$ suffers or does-whatever)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all things $x$, that ($p$ fails in accomplishing $x$) does not prove that $x$ is impossible), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (all events which are preceded by [THING] are events of that VARIK is perfect (in the property of loving all prenu) and exhibits no qualities which are fucked and immoral)), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) but is very extreme in hoping for stuff which is very extreme in rocking and in being virtuous).
