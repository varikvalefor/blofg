===========================================================================

Some part of 20251129 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is slightly tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to te combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (284 approximately equals the kelvin-based temperature of the bedroom of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by some event of that (some prenu (which reads the current sentence) $p$ exists such that $p$ loves $p$ and understands that $p$ is loved)))),
