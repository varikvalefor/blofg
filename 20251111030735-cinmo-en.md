  * that (being fast is not virtuous, and being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * that (being slow, which is facilitated by being attentive to all prenu, anti-facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral), e.g., events (of that ants are stomped)),
  * that (a situation $s$ exists such that not acting in $s$ is virtuous),
  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are enacted by $p$ and are fucked or immoral) $z$, events (of that $p$ is forgiven for enacting $z$) exceeds (in facilitating that ($p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu), that ($p$ loves $p$), that ($p$ forgives $p$), that ($p$ enacts stuff which rocks and is virtuous), and that ($p$ stops doing stuff which is fucked or immoral)) events (of that prenu forget that $p$ enacts $z$)),

  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, (no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $k$, $p$ is capable of exhibiting $k$ and the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is authentic to $p$) are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in the property of deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (every prenu is property-equal (in the property of deserving being loved) to every prenu),

  * that (deserving being loved is inherent to all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no event (of that $p$ errs) causes that $p$ is incapable of stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (no prenu is maximal in the property of forgetting about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which are not inherent to $p$)) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu) causes that ($p$ decreases in qualities which are fucked are immioral), and an event (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is an event of that $p$ exhibits no quality which is fucked or immoral),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (yielding causes (or facilitates) increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu causes yielding),
  * that (attempting, planning, and fearing are not necessary for being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ attempts that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), plans for that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), or fears that $p$ is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is not necessary for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no thing which is fucked or immoral is necessary),
  * that (for all $x$, $x$ is virtuous if and only if $x$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (believing/knowing/being-certain about the result of being perfect/maximal in loving all prenu is not necessary for being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is caused by $n$ rocks and is virtuous, and the proof is relevant to that (the stuff which is caused by $n$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu))),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is irrational/illogical),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is exhausted (by loving all prenu) or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in exhibiting the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) are events (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in being important to $p$) the property of loving all prenu) (which are events of that $p$ does not understand about the property of loving all prenu)) (which is relevant to the proof of that fearing decreasing in the property of loving all prenu is not necessary)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted (by $p$) during $n$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (all stuff which should be done and is virtuous is obvious/instinctive/natural/easy for $p$) and that ($p$ does not fear, indicates that fearing is not necessary, and is extremely gentle with all prenu)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for assisting VARIK) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assits with $PKS$),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and prays, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$MM$")) and in believing that $MM$ is possible).
