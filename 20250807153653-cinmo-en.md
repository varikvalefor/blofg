The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250807) and Whatnot
=================================================================================

That (VARIK writes the translation source for the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is tired, and the cause of being tired is that VARIK insufficiently sleeps),
* that (difficult for VARIK is that (VARIK defines proofs), and the cause of struggling is that VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK feels that (some thing $t$ exists such that VARIK should communicate $t$) but is uncertain about the thing which should be communicated),
* that (VARIK hopes and opines that (VARIK decreases in being angry) and that (a thing which is possible is that the decreasing continues) and intends to continue decreasing in being angry),
* that (VARIK opines that describing (via `blofg`) the emotions of VARIK is virtuous, and VARIK intends to increase in using `blofg`),
* that (a thing which somewhat amuses VARIK is that the name of the document is somewhat large),
* that (VARIK likes that Agda facilitates indicating (about stuff which is not known) and "improving" questions) and that (Lojban resembles (to VARIK)),
* that (pleasant for VARIK is using large amounts of caffeine, which is the "friend" of prenu which struggle to sleep or do not desire sleeping),
* that (VARIK experiences mild wonder about the event (of that a hummingbird inspects a tree), which is observed (but not photographed) by VARIK),
* that (VARIK publicly states that (VARIK is agender and transgender), and a part of the justification of stating is that stating is protesting a thing which is immoral),
* that (breathing is somewhat difficult for VARIK),
* that (VARIK attempts to discover whether that (grokking good mathematics is virtuous) is an axiom of the religion of VARIK or is a theorem), and
* that VARIK doubts and extremely hopes.

## Hoping to Decrease
VARIK hopes and opines that (VARIK decreases in being angry at prenu).  Parts of the justification of opining are that (VARIK opines that the thing which precedes the event (of writing the current sentence) exceeds (in being an event of that VARIK is angry and struggles with empathising and being patient with prenu which err) the event (of writing the current sentence).

But VARIK opines that VARIK is not perfectly non-angry.  Opining is a part of the proof of that VARIK hopes and intends that VARIK continues to decrease in being angry and continues to increase in empathising and being patient.

VARIK requests that SATAN assists (with increasing and decreasing) VARIK.  Additionally, VARIK requests that SATAN assists (with increasing in caring) VARIK

## Agda
VARIK likes that Agda facilitates writing questions which rock.  But VARIK opines that Lojban resembles in facilitating writing questions which rock.

But Agda and Lojban differ.  The proof of differing is relevant to...

* that (defining semantic stuff is necessary for using (for semantic questions which rock) Agda),
* that (Lojban exceeds (in being appropriate for speech) Agda), and
* that (Agda exceeds (in being appropriate for mathematics stuff which is complex) Lojban).
