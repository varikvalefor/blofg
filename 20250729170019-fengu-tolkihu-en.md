# Preventing Anger
Many things $t$ exist such that difficult (for VARIK) is that VARIK is not angry about $t$.  An example is that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ asserts that some prenu is not a prenu.

But some things which facilitate that (VARIK decreases in being angry) are...

* that (VARIK attempts to determine the justification of the thing which angers VARIK),
* that (VARIK remembers that being angry at prenu is immoral by the standard of VARIK),
* praying,
* that (VARIK remembers that being angry [OPPOSITE] {ADVERB} facilitates improving),
* that (VARIK considers whether the prenu (which causes the thing which angers VARIK) understands the implications of the thing which angers VARIK), and
* that (VARIK attempts to determine the emotional cause of being angry).

A part of the justification of writing the thing is that VARIK hopes that the thing facilitates that readers (which desire) decrease in being angry.  VARIK is an example.

VARIK thanks (for assisting (in decreasing in anger) VARIK) SATAN, which is the god of VARIK.

## The Problem
Many things $t$ exist such that difficult (for VARIK) is that VARIK is not angry about $t$.  Examples include...

* computer crashes,
* that (computers are difficult for VARIK),
* that (a thing $t$ is caused such that the harmful nature of $t$ should (per VARIK) be obvious), and
* that (some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu asserts that $p$ is not a prenu).

The anger is a problem for VARIK; the anger prevents doing stuff which is virtuous.  Some things which are relevant to the proof of prevention are...

* that (all anti-facilitators of things which are virtuous prevent doing stuff which is virtuous) and
* that (being angry anti-facilitates empathising, and empathising very facilitates assisting, and assisting is virtuous).

## Stuff which Facilitates Decreasing
Many things $t$ exist such that a thing (which facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$) is...

* that (VARIK attempts (via thinking or questioning) to determine the justification of the thing which angers VARIK),
* that (VARIK remembers that being angry at prenu is immoral),
* praying,
* that (VARIK remembers that being angry anti-facilitates improving),
* that (VARIK considers whether the effects of the thing which angers VARIK are perfectly understood), or
* that (VARIK attempts to determine the emotional cause of the anger).

## Justifications
Many things $t$ exist such that that (VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$) is facilitated by that (VARIK attempts to determine the justification of $t$).  Examples of possible justifications include fear, anger, that (the prenu which causes the thing does not understand that the thing is not necessary), and that (the prenu which causes the thing is uncertain (about a thing which exceeds in being virtuous) and opines that causing _something_ is necessary).

### Being Immoral
Some things $t$ exist such that that (VARIK considers that (being angry is immoral by the standard of VARIK), and VARIK attempts to decrease in being angry because anger is immoral and anti-facilitates stuff which is virtuous) facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$.

But that (VARIK is odd) is possible.

### Anti-Facilitating
Many things $t$ exist such that that (VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$) is justified by that VARIK remembers that being angry anti-facilitates improving.  The proof of anti-facilitating is relevant to...

* that (greatly communicating facilitates increasing (in causing stuff which is virtuous) and discovering flaws),
* that (for all prenu $p_1$, for all prenu $p_2$, that ($p_1$ is angry at $p_2$) anti-facilitates that $p_1$ and $p_2$ greatly communicate), and
* that (for all prenu $p_1$, that ($p_1$) is angry facilitates no stuff which is great).

### Not Understanding
For all actions $t$, "$g\ t$" denotes the indexed type such that for all prenu $p$, a proof of $g\ t\ p$ exists if and only if VARIK assumes or opines that $p$ causes $t$.

Many things $t$ exist such that a thing (which facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$) is that (VARIK considers whether the prenu of $g\ t$ understand that the implications/effects of $t$ are fucked).

VARIK believes that no prenu $p$ and no thing $t$ exist such that ($p$ causes $t$ because $t$ is immoral by the standard of $p$).  The belief is relevant to the proof of that (VARIK opines that no prenu $p$ and no belief (which is immoral by the standard of $p$) $t$ exist such that that ($p$ causes $t$) is contemporaneous with that ($p$ understands that $t$ is immoral by the standard of $p$)).

Difficult for VARIK is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that VARIK is angry at $p$ and opines that $p$ does not understand), a.k.a. "$N$".  But relatively important is that $N$ is immoral by the standard of VARIK.

### The Cause of Anger
For many $t$, a thing which facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry about $t$ is that VARIK considers whether (VARIK is angry about $t$ because (VARIK experiences a "weak" emotion, and society "states" that "weak" emotions are bad)).

#### Examples
Examples of "weak" emotion states include...

* that (VARIK fears $t$),
* that (VARIK fears that that (VARIK is not angry about $t$) facilitates that VARIK increases in tolerating stuff which is immoral or in causing stuff which is immoral), and
* that (VARIK envies some aspect of $t$).

##### Fearing Becoming
Some thing $t_1$ exists such that ((at some time, VARIK is angry about $t_1$), and a thing which facilitates that VARIK is not angry is that VARIK considers whether a part of the cause of anger is that VARIK fears that not being angry about $t_1$ facilitates that VARIK increases in permitting (or causing) stuff which sucks or is immoral).

But being angry is not necessary for not becoming.  The proof of being unnecessary is relevant to...

* that (for all things (which are fucked or immoral) $t$, remembering that $t$ is fucked or immoral facilitates that ($t$ is not caused) and attempting to not cause $t$) and
* that (for all things (which are fucked or immoral) $t$, for all prenu (which attempt (or cause or intend) $t$) $p$, being angry about $t$ anti-facilitates empathising (with $p$), which facilitates explaining (to $p$) that ($t$ is fucked or immoral), and explaining is extreme in anti-facilitating $t$).

## The Justification of Writing
Some prenu $p$ exist such that $p$ is angry about many things and desires that $p$ decreases in being angry.

VARIK is an example.

VARIK hopes that the document facilitates decreasing in being angry.  VARIK hopes that the thing reminds (about stuff which facilitates decreasing in being angry) VARIK.

## Thanking SATAN
VARIK is extremely religious and thanks SATAN, which is the god of VARIK.  VARIK thanks for assisting in decreasing (in being angry) and increasing in causing stuff (which is virtuous)... or in causing attempting to cause stuff which is virtuous.

VARIK believes that SATAN facilitates that VARIK discovers the stuff which facilitates decreasing (in being angry) and increasing in doing stuff which is virtuous.

But for all prenu $p$, possible is that ($p$ opines that (VARIK is silly) because VARIK believes), but the opinion is not a flaw.  Many religions are silly to VARIK.
