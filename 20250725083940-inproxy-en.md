I2P Inproxies
=============

An I2P inproxy is a Web site which facilitates that (a prenu accesses I2P and does not operate an I2P router).

VARIK likes...

* that (I2P inproxies facilitate) and
* that (possible is that using an I2P inproxy is a part of a justification for becoming a thing which owns an I2P router).

But VARIK dislikes...

* that (for all I2P inproxies $t$, easy is that the operator of $t$ reads (or modifies) the stuff which is sent via $t$), a.k.a. "$n_1$",
* that (I2P inproxies facilitate non-privacy), and
* that possible is that a user of an I2P inproxy does not understand that a proof (of that using I2P inproxies differs from not using I2P inproxies) is relevant to $n_1$.

VARIK requests that prenu which very use I2P inproxies create I2P routers.  Creating an I2P router facilitates that (the speed of the I2P network "increases") and whatnot.
