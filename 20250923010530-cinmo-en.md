The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250923) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20250923 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is glad about being agender and about knowing that VARIK is agender),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about being agender and about knowing that VARIK is agender),
* that (VARIK is glad about drawing many queer things which depict VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is slightly amused by that (VARIK suceeds in using (for Canon Digital Photo Professional 4) the OpenBSD computer... but is uncertain about whether Canon Digital Photo Professional 4 is extreme in exceeding RawTherapee, which exceeds in being easily used)),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever {VERB} because VARIK is transgender)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is not certain about whether VARIK is angry at prenu which are not VARIK),
* that (VARIK doubts that VARIK is angry at prenu) (which is dated 20250924033000 and whatnot),
* that (VARIK experiences stress about stuff which is fucked and is immoral),
* that (VARIK is glad about experiencing stress about stuff which is fucked and is immoral),
* that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK suggests that $p$ considers the emotions (of $p$), the stuff (which is spiritually/whatever-ly desired by $p$), whether the actions of $p$ "fit" the beliefs of $p$, and whatnot),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu), a.k.a. "$B$"),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about that (VARIK is not certain about the process of $B$), all events (of hating prenu, e.g., prenu which hate), that (forgetting to empathise or attempt to not kill ants or whatever is easy), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK very hopes that VARIK is capable of $B$),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires that (all prenu understand the property (of loving all prenu and understand that stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible, but attempting is necessary or whatever), that (stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible, but attempting is necessary or whatever), that (no thing proves/indicates that a prenu is evil), and that (violence causes (or whatever) fear, which is extreme in facilitating anger, which is extreme in facilitating violence)), that (all prenu forgive and attempt increasing), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about that (VARIK understands or believes that the property of loving all prenu is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK believes that (no prenu $p$ exists such that a thing $t$ exists such that $p$ causes $t$, and the event (of that $p$ causes $t$) is contemporaneous with that ($p$ understands that $t$ is fucked and is immoral)), a.k.a. "$K$"),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK decreases (in a property which is virtuous) or increases in a property which is immoral)),
* that (VARIK intends to increase (in the property of loving all prenu) and to be maximal/ideal/perfect in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK extremely experiences spiritual hope about $K$, that (no prenu is evil), that (many things which are difficult are possible), that (forgiving, which is unfamiliar to many prenu, facilitates in increasing), that (not being angry at prenu facilitates that prenu discover that stuff which is virtuous, e.g., empathising with all prenu, is possible), that (being angry is not necessary for preventing stuff which is fucked and is immoral), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (VARIK increases in all properties (which are virtuous), e.g., the property of facilitating remembering about love, and decreases in all qualities which are immoral) and that (VARIK discovers the stuff which can be done by VARIK, is virtuous, is anti-violent, facilitates stuff which is virtuous, and prevents stuff which is immoral)), or
* that (VARIK is extreme in expecting stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral), e.g., wars and attempting that prenu which are transgender die, but is very extreme in hoping for stuff which is very extreme in being virtuous and in rocking).

## Canon Digital Photo Professional 4, a.k.a. "$D$"
A sequence of events which happen is...

* that (VARIK attempts using (for $D$) the combination of WINE and Alpine Linux),
* that ($D$ "states" that using the administrator account is necessary for installing $D$),
* that (VARIK attempts using (for $D$) ReactOS),
* that (VARIK discovers that the combination of ReactOS and `vmm(4)` of OpenBSD is slow such that the combination is not appropriate for $D$),
* that (VARIK uses (for installing $D$) a Windows 11 computer),
* that (VARIK sends (from the Windows 11 computer and to the Alpine Linux (virtual machine)) the $D$ files),
* that (VARIK uses (for attempting developing a photograph which depicts a flycatcher) the combination of Alpine Linux, WINE, and $D$),
* that (VARIK is not certain about whether $D$ is extreme in exceeding RawTherapee, which exceeds in being easily used), and
* that (VARIK is slightly amused).
