============================================================================

Some paort of 20251115 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gende dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),

* that (VARIK slightly experiences discomfort/boredom about the process of translating to English),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot),
  * that (every event (which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes/communicates the current sentence) is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which causes that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot) and is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (the 1st event of $PKS$ precedes the events of that VARIK is dead), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that some prenu (which reads the thing) $p$ exists such that $p$ understands that $p$ is loved)),

  * that (the property of loving all prenu is sufficient for that language is insufficient for defining the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or is immoral or is a flaw of $p$, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $s$, $p$ is innately capable of exhibiting $s$ and the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in deserving being loved),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (every event of being awake or whatever is an opportunity for loving all prenu),
  * that (planning, attempting, and fearing are not necessary for being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ attempts that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), plans (for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), or fears that $p$ is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is not necessary for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that some thing, e.g., a thing which is enacted by $p$, causes that $p$ is incapable of doing stuff which is rocking and virtuous),
  * that (for all prenu (which are not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is the method of exhibiting the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
