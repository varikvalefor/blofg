The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251215) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251215 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK _somewhat_ experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event of that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ reads the Blofg post, and $p$ understands that $p$ is loved)))),

* that (the languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of war),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences affluenza),
  * nuclear weapons,
  * violent metaphors/whatever,
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu is angry at $p$ or hates $p$) (which are events of suffering, facilitate that prenu increase in suffering, and are events of that prenu do not understand),
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ is independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff) or that (some prenu which is not $p$ "follows" a religion which is not "followed" by $p$) or opines/whatever that for all prenu $r$, if $r$ is religious, then $r$ attempts that $r$ attempts to "religiously" control/manipulate prenu which are not $r$) in that prenu attempt to religiously control/manipulate $p$),

  * the idea (of hell),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences "religious" trauma),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets about the nature/identity/self/whatever of $p$) in attempting/whatever that prenu like $p$ or are impressed/amazed by the stuff which is done by $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ attempts that ($p$ resembles prenu which are not $p$) and is not authentic to $p$),
