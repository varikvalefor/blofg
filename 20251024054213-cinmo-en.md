The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251024) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251024 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is slightly tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that (being agender is inherent to VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) but acknowledges that being transgender is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (a thing which facilitates that (VARIK decreases in experiencing gender dysphoria) is that VARIK considers that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK), that (the descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK), and VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK and is great in representing VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events of that ("IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious) (which is that VARIK does whatnot and does not strongly desire that VARIK is amused),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu and therefore is anti-violent)),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK forgives (for being not-sufficient in the property of loving all prenu) VARIK),
* that (VARIK somewhat desires that the stuff which is communicated by VARIK is automatically translated to English),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (all events which are preceded by [THING] are events of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (a thing which precedes that VARIK dies is that VARIK is extreme in the property of assisting all prenu which live during [THING]), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous, e.g., that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ forgives $p$)),

* that (languge stuff is insufficient for greatly describing the extent of that (VARIK desires $PKS$)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars (which harm all prenu (which participate in the wars) and whatnot),
  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of dishonesty) or things (which "justify" communicating dishonestly),
  * all events (of affluenza),
  * all events (of that a prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ does not care about the emotions which are experienced by prenu which are not $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (in fearing that $p$ opines a thing (which is incorrect) and is fucked/bad/whatever) for that ($p$ uses logical fallacies) or whatever),
  * that (trains facilitate that prenu are accidentally killed),
  * all events (of opining that a thing which is necessary is that some prenu suffers),
  * all events (of that some prenu does not understand that every prenu is a prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for being amused by mistreating prenu which are not $p$) in forgetting about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (accidentally harming prenu is easy),
  * that (being fast facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * that (many prenu $p$ exist such that (that $p$ is harmed facilitates that $p$ harms prenu)),
  * all events (of hating prenu) (which include events of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ hates $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ (anti-desires)/whatever that $p$ empathises with prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ feels that no prenu loves $p$),
  * that (fearing-or-suffering facilitates violence, which facilitates fearing-or-suffering),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff (which is fucked and immoral), e.g., fogetting about the property of loving all prenu),
  * all events (of suffering),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which are forgiven by VARIK), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (being harsh/forceful is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (jungle music facilitates yielding),
  * that (jungle music is not necessary for yielding),
  * that (no thing which is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu is necessary),
  * that (remembering events which are fucked and immoral is possible),
  * that (a thing which is unnecessary is that SATAN, which is the god of VARIK and is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu, forgives),
  * that (forgiving exceeds (in being virtuous and in facilitating decreasing in suffering) forgetting) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are fucked and immoral and are enacted by $p$) $z$, forgiving (for $z$) $p$ exceeds (in the property (of being virtuous), the property (of anti-facilitating that ($p$ suffers about that ($p$ hates $p$, and the justification is that $p$ enacts $z$))), and the property of facilitating that $z$ is not "repeated")),
  * that (loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to _many_ religions),
  * that (some jokes facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (not joking is not fucked or immoral),
  * that (VARIK succeeds in facilitating that (a cricket $k$ leaves a sidewalk) (which facilitates that $k$ is not stomped/killed)),
  * "`Prami : Prenu -> Prenu`",
  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
  * that (non-linguistically communicating with SATAN is possible and easy for VARIK),
  * that (art is great in facilitating empathising),
  * that (all prenu property-equal (in deserving love) all prenu),
  * that (all prenu are perfect/maximal in deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that that ($p$ plans) is necessary for that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all violence is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * zo'e gi ga je
  * that (being harsh/forceful is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (VARIK is not certain about the future),
  * that (no prenu is evil or fucked/bad/whatever),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of loving all prenu is superlatively virtuous and is superlatively important),
  * that (being slow is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu and anti-facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $k$, $p$ is innately capable of lovingly using $k$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is not rational/reasonable),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are violent and are enacted by $p$) $z$, $z$ is "justified"/"caused" by that ($p$ suffers, fears, does not understand the property of loving all prenu, or does not understand that $z$ is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is an aggregate of actions which are enacted by $p$),
  * that (all prenu are innately capable of yielding),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ yields),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that some thing $x$ exists such that that ($p$ enacts $x$) is contemporaneous with that ($p$ understands that $x$ is fucked or immoral)),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ is tired by loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being excessive in the property of loving all prenu is impossible) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ causes stuff which is fucked or immoral) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that for all prenu $p$, no thing which is not enacted by $p$ causes that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, thatr ($p$ understands that $p$ is loved) facilitates that ($p$ does stuff which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that ($p$ forgives $p$ and decreases in the property of suffering)),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (that being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is inherent to all prenu, e.g., VARIK),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are exhibited by $p$ and are fucked and immoral) (which include being angry at prenu)),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things whih are caused by $n$ are rocking and virtuous)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted (by $p$) during $n$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (stuff which is virtuous and should be done is obvious/instinctive/easy for $p$), that (a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless and anti-desires harming prenu), and that ($p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by all prenu) and whatnot, is not feared, and is extremely gentle with all prenu)),
