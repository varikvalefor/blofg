===========================================================================

Some part of 20251028 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), and that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious) (which is that VARIK does not very desire that VARIK is amused),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK proects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK very cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is spiritually/whatever-ly curious about whether "fucked and immoral" is excessively harsh and about whether a thing is exceeded (by "fucked and immoral") in being harsh and is not exceeded (by "fucked and immoral") in being appropriate/fitting),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (all events which are preceded by that (VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever are events of that (VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu)) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (for all prenu (which can be assisted by VARIK) $p$, that (VARIK is extreme in assisting $p$) precedes that VARIK dies), and
  * that (the Blofg posts facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that some prenu $p$ forgives $p$)),

* that (language stuff is not sufficient for describing the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars,
  * all jails/prisons/whatever,
  * all events (of violence) (which harm the prenu (which cause the events of violence) and whatnot and are "justified"/"cuaused" by fearing, suffering, not understanding about the property of loving all prenu, or whatever),
  * all events (of fuckedly insulting) (which are events of that some prenu $p_1$ exists such that some prenu $p_2$ exists such that $p_1$ insults $p_2$, and (the insult is not a joke, or $p_2$ does not understand that the insult is a joke)),
  * that (competitive society and whatnot facilitate fuckedly joking, i.e., that (jokes which are fucked and immoral are communicated), e.g., the event (of that a prenu sends (to a chatroom which is used by VARIK) a racist joke and is therefore banned)),
  * that (being unattentive facilitates accidentally harming prenu),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ is amused by stuff (which harms prenu) or desires stuff which harms prenu) in not-empathising),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (in being harmed) for that $p$ opines that harming prenu is necessary),
  * all events (which harm prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ excessively brain-thinks) anti-facilitates that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (attempting being fast facilitates stuff which is fucked or immoral),
  * that (being fast facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral), e.g., accidentally stomping ants),
  * that (competitive society and whatnot anti-facilitate that (that (being fast is not virtuous) or (the property of loving all prenu exceeds profiting) is remembered) and admitting that stuff is not known),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts controlling prenu which are not $p$) in fearing that $p$ does not control the experiences of $p$),
  * all events (of that yielding is "difficult" for VARIK, which is familiar with competitive society),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p_1$ exists such that some prenu $p_2$ exists such that $p_1$ is sufficient (for that $p_1$ fears/whatever that $p_1$ empathises with $p_2$) in being harmed (by a thing which is enacted/whatever by $p_2$) or in fearing $p_2$),

  * that (a thing which is possible is lovingly doing mathematics),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting),

  * that (perfectly revering from events which are fucked and immoral is impossible, but learning is possible) (which is that for all dates $d_1$, for all dates $d_2$, for all events (which are fucked and immoral and occur on $d_1$) $n$, that ($d_2$ is an event of changing $n$) is impossible, but a thing which is possible is that $d_2$ is an event of learning from $n$),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are caused by $p$ rock {VERB} and are virtuous)),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which is that the property of loving all prenu is incompatible with all qualities which are fucked or immoral, and for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu) causes that ($p$ decreases in all qualities which are fucked or immoral)),
  * that (for all prenu (which are not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) facilitates that $p$ understands the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is exhausted by loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that a thing which is not enacted by $p$ causes that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, all things which cause that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu are events of that $p$ chooses that some thing exceeds (in being important/whatever to $p$) the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted (by $p$) during $n$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that ($p$ does not fear), that ($p$ indicates that fearing the property of loving all prenu is not necessary), that ($p$ is extreme in being gentle), that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot), that (a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless and anti-desires all stuff which harms prenu), and that (the stuff which is virtuous and should be done by $p$ is obvious/instinctive/easy for $p$)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual non-fear about that (for all $x$, $x$ is virtuous if-and-only-if $f$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK thanks (for explaining (for VARIK) (by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK prays and holds a BLÅHAJ, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral), is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by $MM$)) and in believing that ($MM$ is possible), and is not certain about $MM$).
