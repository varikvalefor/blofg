The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251028) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251028 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), and that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious) (which is that VARIK does not very desire that VARIK is amused),

* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK proects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK very cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is spiritually/whatever-ly curious about whether "fucked and immoral" is excessively harsh and about whether a thing is exceeded (by "fucked and immoral") in being harsh and is not exceeded (by "fucked and immoral") in being appropriate/fitting),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (all events which are preceded by that (VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever are events of that (VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu)) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (for all prenu (which can be assisted by VARIK) $p$, that (VARIK is extreme in assisting $p$) precedes that VARIK dies), and
  * that (the Blofg posts facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that some prenu $p$ forgives $p$)),

* that (language stuff is not sufficient for describing the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars,
  * all jails/prisons/whatever,
  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of fuckedly insulting) (which are events of that some prenu $p_1$ exists such that some prenu $p_2$ exists such that $p_1$ insults $p_2$, and (the insult is not a joke, or $p_2$ does not understand that the insult is a joke)),
  * that (competitive society and whatnot facilitate fuckedly joking, i.e., communicating jokes which are fucked and immoral),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ excessively brain-thinks) anti-facilitates that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (attempting being fast facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * that (competitive society and whatnot anti-facilitate remembering that beign fast is not virtuous),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p_1$ exists such that some prenu $p_2$ exists such that $p_1$ is sufficient (for that $p_1$ fears/whatever that $p_1$ empathises with $p_2$) in being harmed (by a thing which is enacted/whatever by $p_2$) or in fearing $p_2$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ exhibits the qualities which are inherent to $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ feels/whatever that $p$ is not loved),
  * all events (of suffering),
  * all events (of that (VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)) (which are forgiven by VARIK), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (cooperating is possible),
  * that (the property (of being angry) and whatnot are inherent to no prenu),
  * that (for all actions (which are fucked and immoral) $z$, a thing which is possible is empathising with the prenu (which enacts $z$) and the prenu which are harmed by $z$),
  * that (a thing which is possible is lovingly doing mathematics),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, an event of loving $p$ is an event of that (a prenu cares (about the actions which are immoral and are enacted by $p$), and the justification of caring is that the actions indicate that $p$ suffers)),
  * that (jungle music facilitates yielding),
  * that (jungle music is not necessary for yielding),
  * that (remembering events which are fucked and immoral is possible),

  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is an aggregate of actions which are enacted by $p$),
  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
  * that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK),
  * that (VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK, is great in representing VARIK),
  * that (the descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (a thing which is unnecessary is requesting that SATAN forgives),
  * that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK non-linguistically communicates with SATAN),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to _many_ religions), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),

  * that (no prenu is evil or fucked/bad/whatever),
  * that (all stuff which is harsh is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ plans) is not necessary for that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that $p$ is loved) facilitates that $p$ decreases in suffering and exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (perfectly revering from events which are fucked and immoral is impossible, but learning is possible) (which is that for all dates $d_1$, for all dates $d_2$, for all events (which are fucked and immoral and occur on $d_1$) $n$, that ($d_2$ is an event of changing $n$) is impossible, but a thing which is possible is that $d_2$ is an event of learning from $n$),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are caused by $p$ rock {VERB} and are virtuous)),
  * that (VARIK increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being active/busy is not virtuous) (which is that some event of being active/busy is immoral, and some situation $s$ exists such that $s$ is a situation of that (being "idle" is virtuous)),
  * that (every prenu is innately capable of yielding),
  * that (for all things $x$, $x$ is virtuous if and only if $x$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which is that the property of loving all prenu is incompatible with all qualities which are fucked or immoral, and for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu) causes that ($p$ decreases in all qualities which are fucked or immoral)),
  * that (for all prenu (which are not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ yields),
  * that (that (VARIK attempts/whatever) is not necessary for that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (that (VARIK welcomes/permits that VARIK is loved) facilitates that VARIK increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being innately capable of being maximal/perfect in the property of loving all prenu is inherent to every prenu),
  * that (all prenu property-equal (in being important and in deserving being loved) all prenu),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in deserving being loved),
  * that (prenu differ (in qualities which are not the property of deserving being loved) from prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is irrational),
  * that (being excessive in the property of loving all prenu is impossible) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is sufficient (for stuff which is fucked or immoral) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is exhausted by loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that a thing which is not enacted by $p$ causes that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, all things which cause that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu are events of that $p$ chooses that some thing exceeds (in being important/whatever to $p$) the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted (by $p$) during $n$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (no prenu $r$ exists such that $p$ fears $r$), that ($p$ indicates that fearing the property of loving all prenu is not necessary), that ($p$ is extreme in being gentle), that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot), that (a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless and anti-desires all stuff which harms prenu), and that (the stuff which is virtuous and should be done by $p$ is obvious/instinctive/easy for $p$)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for explaining (for VARIK) (by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK prays and holds a BLÅHAJ, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$),
