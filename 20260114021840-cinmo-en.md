The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20260114 or 20260115) and Whatnot
=======================================================================================

Some part of 20260114 or 20260115 is an event of...

* that (VARIK consumes caffeine, and the milligramme-based amount roughly equals 300),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender, and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK _slightly_ experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events (of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent, is gentle, and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK _somewhat_ considers_ translating (to Perl and from `rc`) the definition of SWERC, which is used by VARIK and for the Web site which is operated by VARIK),
* that (VARIK is somewhat annoyed) (which is that VARIK is excessively annoyed),
* that (VARIK sarcastically communicates a thing $x$ such that VARIK is not certain about whether communicating $x$ is an event of that VARIK attempts that (VARIK amuses) and-not whatnot),
* that (VARIK hopes for that the sarcasm thing harms no prenu),
* that (VARIK is not annoyed),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK _slightly_ cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...
	* that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
	* that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous))),
* that (all languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),

	* all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ is independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff) or that (some prenu which is not $p$ "follows" a religion which is not "followed" by $p$) or opines/whatever that (for all prenu $r$, if $r$ is religious, then $r$ attempts "religiously" controlling/manipulating prenu which are not $r$)) in that prenu attempt/whatever to "religiously" control/manipulate $p$),
