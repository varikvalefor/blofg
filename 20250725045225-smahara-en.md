# ASMR Stuff Thing
VARIK desires that (VARIK creates some ASMR videos regarding the process of drawing), a.k.a. "$f$".

But difficult for VARIK is that VARIK speaks, which is necessary for $f$.  Additionally, difficult for VARIK is that (that (VARIK discovers things which should be said) is contemporaneous with that (VARIK records)), which is necessary (or whatever) for $f$.

A thing which is possible is that VARIK records a voice track (which is fucked), a.k.a. "$v$'.  But possible is that observing a video with $v$ justifies observing no ASMR videos which are created by VARIK.  Additionally, possible is that (VARIK records $v$ but does not upload a $v$ video), which resembles idling and is unpleasant for VARIK;  speaking is unpleasant for VARIK.

For all things $n$, for all prenu $p$, if $p$ opines that possible is that $p$ facilitates $f$, then VARIK welcomes suggesting $f$.
