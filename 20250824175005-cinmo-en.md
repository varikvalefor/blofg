The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250824) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is slow in translating (to English and from Lojban) the blofg posts which are created by VARIK),
* that (VARIK desires an automatic translator which differs (from neural networks) in outputting stuff which rocks in being appropriate for the input),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is not extremely angry at prenu, is glad about that (VARIK is not extremely angry at prenu), but intends to continue decreasing in being angry at prenu),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by that (dust is attached to the sensor of the camera which is used by VARIK), intends to "fix" the thing, but is glad (or whatever) about that (the thing is not extreme)),
* that (VARIK suggests that users of DSLR (or DSLM) cameras attempt to determine (via GIMP) whether dust is attached to the sensor),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain/(complaint emotion) about that (many prenu attend to stuff (which is not morally important) and ignore stuff which is morally important)),
* that (VARIK suggests that (a thing considers the cause of difficulty in doing stuff which is virtuous) (which facilitates increasing in being willing to do stuff which is virtuous), suggests considering (whether stuff which is attended is important), and suggests attempting to determine stuff which is morally important),
* that (VARIK attempts to find a thing $t$ such that (VARIK is capable of doing $t$, and $t$ causes or facilitates increasing (in qualities which are virtuous) or "improving" things)),
* that (VARIK intends to be a vegan),
* that (easy for VARIK is that (VARIK naturally desires that a thing automatically describes the emotions which are experienced by VARIK), but VARIK knows that non-automatically-assistedly describing emotions exceeds (in facilitating improvement) automatic descriptions),
* that (VARIK attempts that (if VARIK is aware of stuff which is good, then VARIK does stuff which is good... and causes no thing which is immoral)),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that VARIK increases (in all qualities which are virtuous) and decreases in all qualities which are immoral), and
* that VARIK hopes, i.e., that VARIK opines that stuff which is virtuous is unlikely but possible.

## Gender Dysphoria
That (VARIK writes the translation source of the current message) is contemporaneous with that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria.

"VERY" does not apply.  "SOMEWHAT" does not apply.  VARIK is glad about that "VERY" does not apply.  But VARIK experiences [COMPLAINT EMOTION] about that "SOMEWHAT" and "NOT" do not apply.

## The Process of Finding Dust
A sequence of events which happen is...

* that (VARIK photographs a light source, and the aperture is small, and the lens is focused on no thing),
* that (VARIK "adds" (to a GIMP thing) the photograph),
* that (VARIK copies the original layer (of the photograph), a.k.a. "$l_1$", and the result is $l_2$),
* that (VARIK "applies" (to $l_2$) a gaussian blur thing),
* that (the layer mode of $l_2$ "becomes" Difference),
* that ($l_1$ and $l_2$ are combined, and the result is $l$),
* that (MANTIUK 2006 is "applied" to $l$, and the result indicates the dust which is attached to the sensor of the camera which is used for creating the photograph).

## Experiencing Spiritual Pain about Caring about Things which are Not Important
Many prenu $t$ exist such that ($t$ attends to stuff (which is not important or desired by $t$) suc htaht $t$ ignores stuff (which is important to $t$), or stuff which is virtuous is difficult for $t$).

VARIK experiences spiritual pain about the situation (which is described "in" the previous sentence), a.k.a. "$f$".

But VARIK opines that some things (which can facilitate that a thing increases (in attending to stuff which is important) and decreases in attending to stuff which is unimportant) are...

* that (a thing attempts to determine/discover stuff which is important),
* that (a thing $l$ attempts to determine/discover the reason for the stuff which is caused by $l$),
* that (a thing $l$ considers the stuff which is spiritually-or-whatever {ADVERB} desired by $l$), and
* that (a thing $l$ considers whether the actions of $l$ are appropriate for the spiritual-or-whatever desires of $l$).

Additionally, VARIK opines that some things (which facilitate decreasing in struggling to do things which are virtuous) are...

* that (a thing considers the cause of the difficulty) and
* that (a thing discovers the parts $P$ such that the thing which is difficult is composed of $P$).
