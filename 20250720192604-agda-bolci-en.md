# The Agda Ball
Many things $t$ exist such that $t$ is an event of that VARIK considers that (VARIK draws that (VUNC becomes ready to throw a ball $b$ such that Agda definitions are the material of $b$)), a.k.a. "$p$"... and of that VARIK somewhat desires drawing $p$.  But VARIK somewhat dislikes that the thing is relevant to Agda and-not whatnot.  Additionally, however, VARIK dislikes that the mathematical notation which is not an Agda thing is not perfectly (syntactically unambiguous).
