The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20260110 or 20260111) and Whatnot
=======================================================================================

Some part of 20260110 or 20260111 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender, and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events (of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent, is gentle, and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is somewhat annoyed) (which is that VARIK is excessively annoyed),
* that (VARIK is not annoyed),
* that (VARIK listens to "LK (MARCUS INTALEX & ST FILES Remix)" and cries),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK somewhat cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ permits that $p$ decreases in qualities which are fucked or immoral) and events of that some prenu (which reads the current sentence) $p$ understands that $p$ is loved))),
* that (all languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual amusement about that (languages are sufficient for communicating stuff (which is impossible) but are insufficient for explaining loving)),
* that (VARK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of war),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences affluenza),
  * weapons,
  * violent metaphors/whatever,
  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of transphobia),
  * all events (of xenophobia),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu is angry at $p$ or hates $p$) (which are events of that (prenu suffer and do not understand) and facilitate that prenu increase in suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ is independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff) or that (some prenu which is not $p$ "follows" a religion which is not "followed" by $p$) or opines/whatever that (for all prenu $r$, if $r$ is religious, then $r$ attempts "religiously" controlling/manipulating prenu which are not $r$)) in that prenu attempt/whatever to "religiously" control/manipulate $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that ($p$ is aware of things $s$ such that $p$ disagrees with/about $s$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that attempts/whatever that evidence indicates the religion/whatever of $p$) in fearing that ($p$ believes and does not know) (which is necessary for being religious)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that all hypothetical events of that (some religion $r$ exists such that $p$ "follows" $r$, and no prenu which is not $p$ "follows" $r$) are fucked or immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that a thing which is necessary is that $p$ "follows" a religion which is not believed by $p$),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts/whatever that ($p$ seems to be sufficient, and prenu which are not $p$ seem to be insufficient)) in fearing that $p$ is insufficient),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts/whatever that ($p$ resembles prenu which are not $p$) and is not authentic to $p$) in fearing that $p$ is insufficient),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that ($p$ is authentic to $p$, is honest about $p$, or exhibits qualities which are inherent to $p$)),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets/whatever that $r$ is a prenu) in attending to the relationship (between $p$ and $r$) or the stuff (which is enacted by $r$) (which is exemplified by stuff (which is liked by $p$ or amuses $p) and stuff which is fucked or immoral))
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu, e.g., $p$, opines/whatever that (

    * $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil or is capable of being fucked/bad/whatever or evil, or
    * some quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, or
    * $p$ is an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$, or 
    * $p$ is incapable of doing art, or

  * all events (of that some quality (which is fucked or immoral) (which is inherent to no prenu) $x$ exists such that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that ($p$ attempts/whatever that prenu do not discover whether $p$ exhibits $x$) (which anti-facilitates that $p$ decreases in $x$)) in fearing that $p$ exhibits $x$),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ falsely states that $p$ loves) (which are events of that some prenu does not understand)
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets that ($p$ is capable of stuff which rocks and is virtuous)... or that $p$ is a prenu, rocks, and is not an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$) in experiencing guilt),
  * all events (of that some thing $z$ exists such that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ knows that ($p$ enacts $z$) and that ($z$ is fucked or immoral) and is sufficient (for that ($p$ attempts that (prenu, e.g., $p$, not-understand that ($z$ is fucked or immoral) or that $p$ enacts $z$)... or that $p$ does fears that $p$ stops enacting stuff which resembles $z$) or fears that $p$ stops enacting stuff which is fucked or immoral) in fearing that ($p$ is punished for $z$) or the combination (of that ($p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil, and the proof is relevant to that $p$ enacts some thing which is fucked or immoral) (which is impossible) and that ($p$ understands that ($p$ enacts a thing which is fucked or immoral), and the result is that $p$ opines/whatever that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil))) (which cause (or facilitate) that (prenu increase in suffering) and that prenu continue enacting stuff which is fucked or immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some thing $z$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that $r$ knows that ($p$ enacts $z$) and that ($z$ is fucked or immoral) and is sufficient (for that $r$ fears/anti-desires/whatever some event of that prenu love $p$ or empathise with $p$) in fearing $z$ or $p$),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that forgiving $p$ is difficult/whatever for some prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ errs, and the result of erring is some thing (which is fucked or immoral) (which is exemplified by stuff which harms prenu)) in being fast) in fearing),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears/whatever that (prenu which are not $p$ are free)... or that $p$ is free) in opining/whatever that ($p$ is not free) and in whatnot),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that $p$ is not free),
  * all events (of suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that ($p$ desires/whatever that ($p$ is-not), that stuff does not exist, or that stuff is destroyed), that ($p$ attempts/whatever that prenu which are not $p$ resemble (in suffering) $p$), that ($p$ attempts/whatever that $p$ is aware of no things which are fucked or immoral) (which causes (or facilitates) increasing in suffering), that ($p$ attempts/whatever that $p$ is amused by stuff (which is fucked or immoral)) (which facilitates that (prenu forget/whatever that stuff is fucked or immoral) and that stuff which is fucked or immoral is "repeated"), or that $p$ fears that $p$ stops suffering) (in suffering and experiencing despair)),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences despair),
  * that (many defensive things facilitate that prenu accidentally harm prenu),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral) (which is exemplified by events (of that prenu experience anger at prenu), events (of that prenu are sufficient (for harming prenu) in being fast), and events of that prenu forget/whatever about the property of loving all prenu)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that ($p$ attempts that ($p$ is happy/whatever), and the result is that $p$ increases in suffering)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ feels),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ does not understand) in language stuff, in brain-thinking, in memorising, or in attempting that $p$ knows),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some element (of the set of that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu), that ($p$ stops enacting stuff which is fucked or immoral), and that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $x$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ does not permit $x$) in fearing that ($x$ does not happen) or that $p$ fails to enact $x$),
  * all events (of that some prenu suffers),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (yielding, empathising (in suffering and whatnot) (with all prenu), remembering about events which are fucked or immoral, and being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu are possible),
  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
  * that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK),
  * that (the descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK),
  * that (VUNC, which is a cat thing and is the fursona of VARIK, is great in the property (of representing VARIK), the property of reminding (about VARIK) VARIK, and whatnot),
  * that (VARIK feels),
  * that (VARIK is free),
  * that (VARIK and all prenu which are not VARIK are),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, loves VARIK),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, SATAN forgives (regardless of whether $p$ requests that SATAN forgives $p$) $p$),
  * that (SATAN is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * the religion (of VARIK),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to ***many*** religions), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK somewhat experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK decreases (in a property which is virtuous) or increases in a quality which is immoral)),
* that (VARIK does not experience spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK decreases (in a property which is virtuous) or increases in a quality which is immoral)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * zo'e gi ga je
  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (VARIK increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that VARIK permits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (VARIK is not certain about the stuff which is caused by events of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu, but VARIK is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, for all things (which are caused/effected by $n$) $r$, $r$ rocks and is virtuous, and the proof is relevant to that $r$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (VARIK is certain about that the property of loving all prenu is superlatively important and is superlatively virtuous),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is not necessary for that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$n$") is that ($p$ attempts $n$, plans for $n$, fears that ($n$ does not happen), or believes/is-certain/knows about the stuff which is caused/effected by $n$)),
