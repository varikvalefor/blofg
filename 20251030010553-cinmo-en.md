The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251030) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251030 is an event of...

* that (VARIK oddly sleeps),
* that (VARIK is slightly tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun and refers to VARIK),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK very cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot),
  * that (all events which are preceded by the event (of that VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever are events of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$" and logically necessitates/implies that VARIK feels the suffering (of all prenu) and whatnot),
  * that (the 1st event of $PKS$ precedes that VARIK dies), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous)),

* that (language stuff is insufficient for greatly describing the extent of that VARIK desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars,
  * all violence (which is "justified"/"caused" by that the prenu which enacts the violence fears {V}, suffers, does not understand the property of loving all prenu, or does not understand that violence is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu, or does whatever),
  * violent metaphors,
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu believes/whatever that $p$ is not a prenu),
  * all events (of that a prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ opines that suffering is necessary) in suffering),
  * all events (of that a prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ does not brain-think),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines that (loving all prenu is impossible) or whatever),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that (a thing which is "difficult" for $p$ is that ($p$ loves $p$), or $p$ believes/whatever that a thing which is fucked or immoral is that $p$ loves $p$)),
  * all events (of fuckedly insulting) (which are events of that some prenu $p_1$ exists such that some prenu $p_2$ exists such that ($p_1$ insults $p_2$, and (the justification of insulting is not that ($p_1$ desires that $p_2$ is amused), or $p_2$ does not understand that (the event of insulting is an event of joking), or the insulting harms $p_2$))),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (in suffering) for that $p$ attempts/desires/whatever that prenu resemble (in suffering) $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ believes/whatever that $p$ "is" an aggregate of the actions which are enacted by $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears/(anti-desires)/whatever that prenu are free) in feeling that $p$ is controlled),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ attempts controlling/manipulating prenu which are not $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences despair),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ feels that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ is independent in spiritually considering stuff),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears/whatever that prenu "follow" religions which are anot followed by $p$) in experiencing religious trauma),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences religious trauma),
  * events (of that prenu determine whether a thing which is fucked and immoral exceeds (in being fucked and immoral) a thing which is fucked and immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some thing (which is enacted by $p$) $z$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (in fearing that $z$ indicates that $p$ is evil or whatever) for that ($p$ attempts that (prenu forget about $p$) or that $p$ believes that $p$ is great/virtuous) (which causes that $p$ suffers)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu opines that a thing which is necessary is that $p$ suffers or is harmed),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears the idea of loving all prenu) in being unfamiliar with the property of loving all prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu (which opines that $p$ enacts some thing which is fucked or immoral) $s$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $s$ anti-desires/whatever that $s$ empathises with $r$) in fearing $p$),
  * all events (of mistreating prenu),
  * all events (of that prenu are angry at prenu, or prenu are hated) (which include events of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ hates $p$ or is angry at $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears $p$),
  * all events (of experiencing trauma),
  * all things (which harm prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu feels that $p$ is not loved),
  * all events (of that a thing which is "difficult" for VARIK, which is familiar with competitive society and whatnot, yields),
  * that (being unattentive facilitates accidentally enacting stuff which harms prenu, e.g., prenu which "inhabit" ants),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral), e.g., forgetting about the property of loving all prenu),
  * all events (of suffering),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which are forgiven by VARIK), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (the property of loving all prenu is sufficient for that (langage stuff is insufficient for explaining the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (all stuff which is harsh is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (competing is not necessary),
  * that (a thing which is possible is remembering stuff which is fucked or immoral, e.g., events (which are accidental and cause that prenu die) and events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (in being unfamiliar with the property of loving all prenu) for that $p$ enacts (with the intent of killing prenu) stuff)),
  * that (empathising, yielding, and exhibiting the property of loving all prenu are possible),
  * that (VARIK remembers about the wasp $b$ such that the process (of that $b$ dies) is observed by VARIK),
  * that (that (VARIK is happy) is not a goal of VARIK),
  * that (art facilitates empathising),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ loves all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all prenu $r$, that ($p$ loves $r$) is an event of that ($p$ cares about the stuff which is fucked or immoral and is enacted by $p$, and the justification of caring about the stuff is that the stuff indicates that $r$ suffers)... and that $p$ understands that $r$ is not the stuff which is enacted by $r$),
  * that (prenu differ (in qualities which are not the quality of deserving being loved) from prenu),
  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
  * that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK),
  * that (the descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK),
  * that (VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK, is great in representing VARIK),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK non-linguistically communicates with SATAN),
  * that (SATAN explains (for VARIK and by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to _many_ religions, e.g., Taoism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spirtual hope about that...

  * zo'e gi ga je
  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * that (VARIK does not control the future, and VARIK is not certain about the future),
  * that (all prenu are innately capable of yielding),
  * that (for all prenu (which are not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ yields),
  * that (brain-thinking is not virtuous),
  * that (permitting not exhibiting qualities which are fucked or immoral facilitates not exhibiting qualities which are fucked or immoral),
  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
  * that (being fast is not virtuous),
  * that (being slow anti-facilitates stuff which is fucked or is immoral),
  * that (being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $c$, $p$ is innately capable of lovingly exhibiting $c$),
  * that (all things (which are caused by any event of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) rock and are virtuous),
  * that (for all things $x$, $x$ is virtuous if-and-only-if $x$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (fearing is not necessary),
  * that (attempting-or-planning is not necessary for being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$), which are not inherent to $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that $p$ understands that $p$ is loved facilitates that $p$ decreases (in suffering) and increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is authentic to $p$) are compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no prenu is capable of being maximal in forgetting about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is inherent to every prenu),
  * that (no thing which is fucked or immoral is necessary),
  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, property-equal {VERB} (in being important and in deserving being loved) all prenu),
  * that (all prenu are perfect/maximal in deserving being loved),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, every event (of that $p$ is awake or whatever) is an opportunity for exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (changing the past is impossible),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is an aggregate of stuff which is enacted by $p$),
  * that (spiritually considering the property of loving all prenu facilitates exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is irrational/illogical),
  * that (being excessive in the property of loving all prenu is impossible) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is sufficient (for stuff which is fucked or immoral) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is sufficient (for that (loving all prenu tires $p$) or that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that for all prenu $p$, every (of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) is an event of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in being important to $p$) the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), but VARIK is certain about that (for every prenu $p$, for every event (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are caused by $n$ are rocking and virtuous)),
