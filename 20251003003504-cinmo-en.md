* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),

  * that ("shadows of love will shelter you" and "you don't have to be dark to be raw" are spiritually important to VARIK) and

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ does not understands the property of loving all prenu)),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (VARIK believes),
  * that (loving all prenu is the way/method of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (prenu are not actions) (which is that a prenu $p$ exists such that loving $p$ is not approving some action of $p$),
  * that (loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to _many_ religions),
  * that (improving is possible),
  * that (all events of violence are "justified"/"caused" by suffering or whatever),

  * that (loving all prenu is the answer/solution),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, an event (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is an event (of that the stuff (which should be done by $p$), which is virtuous, is obvious for $p$)), and
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, are capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that no prenu is incapable of being maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),

* that (VARIK linguistically prays a prayer (which is grammatical w.r.t. the grammar of Lojban and indicates that VARIK desires that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)... and holds a BLÃ…HAJ),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu and exhibits no quality (which is immoral), e.g., the quality (of being angry) or the quality of being defensive)), or
* that (VARIK is extreme (in expecting stuff which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping for stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous).

## A Linguistic Prayer
VARIK requests (from SATAN) that SATAN assists with that (all events which are preceded by [THING] and are events of that (VARIK is awake) exhibit the property (of being an event of that (VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu), a.k.a. "$VKN$")).

All $VKN$ events are events (of that all things which are enacted by VARIK are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu) and are events (of that VARIK is extreme in being gentle).

All $VKN$ events are events (of that VARIK is angry at no prenu).  That (VARIK is angry at no prenu) is extremely compatible with events (of assisting prenu) and events of preventing stuff which is fucked and immoral.

All $VKN$ events are events (of that VARIK is extreme in crying).  VARIK knows.  Being extreme in crying is a non-problem and indicates that harming is anti-desired.

All $VKN$ events are events (of that (for all prenu $p$, feels the suffering which is experienced by $p$), which is unpleasant but is rocking and virtuous).

The justification of requesting is that VARIK desires.

The justification of desiring is that the thing is in accordance with loving all prenu.
