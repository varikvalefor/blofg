=======================================================================================

Some part of 20251117 or 20251118 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), and that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender), which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violence and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences pain about that (VARIK attempts that (VARIK reads)... and does not use reading glasses)),
* that (VARIK is slightly amused by the reading glasses thing),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (a Blofg post (which is created by VARIK) $b$ exists such that $b$ is sufficient (for that the automatic parser is incompatible/whatever with $b$) in being large)),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (VARIK is slow in creating the Agda definition of the grammar (of the Lojban which is used by VARIK) and whatnot)),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot),
  * that (every event (which is preceded by that (VARIK writes the current sentence) is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that (for some prenu (which reads the current sentence) $p$, $p$ understands that $p$ is loved))),

* that (the languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),

  * that (loving all prenu is the method of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (loving all prenu is the "explanation" of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, events (of that $p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) cause (or facilitate) that $p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is enacted (by $p$) during $n$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot), that ($p$ does not fear, indicates that fearing is not necessary, and is extremely gentle with all prenu), and that a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for assisting VARIK, for explaining (for VARIK) the property of loving all prenu, and for that (VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK exist)) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists (with $PKS$) VARIK),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and prays, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$MM$"))nd in believing that $MM$ is possible).
