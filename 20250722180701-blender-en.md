# Blender
VARIK becomes a thing which uses (for many drawings which are created by VARIK) Blender.  That (VARIK struggles with perspective stuff) is a part of the justification of using Blender.

But many events of that VARIK uses (for drawing sketches) Blender are events of that Blender crashes.  The crashing is very using the CPU and not responding to the mouse movements which are caused by VARIK.

VARIK is not certain about the cause of crashing.

VARIK desirees that VARIK likes Blender.  VARIK remembers about that Blender is great and does not (frequently crash).
