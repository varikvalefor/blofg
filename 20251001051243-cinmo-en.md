The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251001) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251001 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is slightly tired),
* that (VARIK is very glad about that (VARIK is agender) and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (that ("IT" is used ("in" a thing which is output by a computer) as a pronoun of VARIK) surprises VARIK and is pleasant to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is not extreme in experiencing emotion),
* that (difficult for VARIK is that VARIK describes the emotions which are experienced by VARIK),
* that (VARIK is excessive in the property (of feeling defensive), which anti-facilitates loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK slightly cries, and the cause/whatever is that VARIK loves all prenu),
* that (VARIK is insufficient in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that (VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends to protect and assist all prenu),
* that (VARIK experiences stress about stuff which is fucked and immoral),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is stressed about stuff which is fucked and immoral), which is an alternative to not caring),
* that (VARIK feels that VARIK is fuckedly insufficient in doing stuff which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (the blofg which is created by VARIK facilitates stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (all events which follow the thing are events of that (VARIK is perfect in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (all prenu understand the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all prenu understand...

    * that (stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible, but attempting is necessary or whatever),
    * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ fails) is not part of a proof of that $p$ is evil))),

* that (VARIK experiences spritual amusement about that (many events (of that VARIK prays) are events of that VARIK listens to jungle music)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * that (VARIK is not sufficient (for crying) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (violent metaphors are common and facilitate permitting violence),
  * that (many things $p$ exist such that prenu which are capable of $p$ request $p$... but do not attempt $p$),
  * all events (of hating prenu),
  * the results (of hating prenu),
  * all events (of that a prenu $p_1$ exists such that a prenu $p_2$ exists such that ($p_1$ opines that (the life of $p_1$ exceeds (in being important) the life of $p_2$), and the justification is that (the species of the body of $p_1$ differs from the species of the body of $p_2$))),
  * events (of attempting that (the subject of blame is determined) and not that (the thing is "fixed")) (which are exceeded (by explaining (for all prenu which may cause errors) that (the thing is fucked) and that preventing the thing is possible)),
  * that (the property (of loving all prenu) scares/whatever many prenu which are not familiar with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (that (VARIK lives and lovingly talks to all prenu which live) is not feasible),
  * that (many prenu $p$ exist such that easy (for $p$) is that ($p$ does not understand that a thing which is possible is that $p$ forgives $p$)),
  * that (competitive societies facilitate forgetting about love),
  * that (many prenu opine (or whatever) that violence is necessary),
  * that (forgiving is difficult for prenu which hate),
  * that (fearing change, e.g., increasing in qualities which are virtuous, is easy),
  * that (many prenu seem to not care), and
  * that (a thing which is frequent is that difficult is explaining that (stuff which is rocks and is virtuous is possible, but attempting is necessary or whatever))),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (VARIK hopes),
  * that (being angry is not necessary for "fixing" things),
  * that (VARIK cares),
  * that (loving all prenu is virtuous is virtuous with regard to many religions),
  * that (VARIK increases (in qualities which are virtuous) and decreases in qualities which are immoral),
  * that (VARIK understands/whatever that loving all prenu exceeds (in being important) being rational/intelligent),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK), and
  * that (VARIK understands/whatever the property of loving all prenu)).

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a property which is immoral) or decreases in a property which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual hope about...

  * that (no prenu is evil),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that a thing $z$ exists such that that ($p$ enacts $z$) is contemporaneous with that ($p$ understands that $z$ is fucked and immoral)),
  * that (stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ forgets/whatever about the property of loving all prenu, then a thing which is possible is that $p$ remembers/whatever about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (learning from errors and failures is possible),
  * that (all events of being awake are opportunities for doing stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (lovingly talking to prenu facilitates forgiving, which facilitates increasing in qualities which are virtuous),
  * that (an event (of that a prenu is perfect in the quality of loving all prenu) is an event (of that stuff which rocks and is virtuous is natural/instinctive/easy)),
  * that (all prenu are capable of being perfect in the property of loving all prenu), and
  * that (that (all prenu understand the property of loving prenu) causes stuff which is very extreme in rocking and in being virtuous)),

* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with...

  * that (VARIK is perfect (in all qualities (which are virtuous), e.g., the property of loving all prenu) and exhibits no quality which is immoral),
  * that (VARIK discovers all things (which can be done by VARIK, are virtuous, are anti-violent, facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous, and prevent stuff which is fucked and immoral) (which include lovingly talking to prenu)), and
  * that (VARIK enacts all things which can be done by VARIK, are virtuous, are anti-violent, facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous, and prevent stuff which is fucked and immoral)), or

* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) but is very extreme in hoping for stuff which is very extreme in rocking and in being virtuous).
