The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251026 or 20251027) and Whatnot
=======================================================================================

Some part of 20251026 or 20251027 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK consumes a small amount of caffeine),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), and that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender), which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that a thing which facilitates that VARIK decreases in experiencing gender dysphoria is that VARIK spiritually-or-whateverly considers that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK), that (descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK), and VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK excessively jokes),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and asssits all prenu), which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (in the property of loving all prenu) for that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK observes the process (of that a wasp dies)... and cries),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (all events which are preceded by [THING] or the event (of that VARIK writes the current sentence) are events of that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), which causes that the events (of that VARIK is awake or whatever) are events of that VARIK cries) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (a thing which precedes that VARIK dies is that for all prenu (which can be assisted (during that (VARIK lives)) by VARIK) $p$, that ($p$ is extreme in assisting $p$) precedes that VARIK dies),
  * that (the first $PKS$ event precedes that VARIK dies), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that (some prenu (which reads the Blofg posts) $p$ exists such that $p$ forgives $p$))),

* that (language stuff is insufficient for greatly describing the extent of that (VARIK desires $PKS$)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars,
  * all violence,
  * the process (of that the wasp dies),
  * all events (of mistreating prenu) (which include events of communicating jokes which anti-facilitate empathising with prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (in suffering or fearing) for that $p$ anti-desires (or does-whatever) that $p$ empathises with prenu which enact stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (in fearing/whatever that $p$ is behaves authentically) for that $p$ anti-desires (or does-whatever) that a prenu is weird or whatever),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (in that forgiving $p$ is difficult for $p$) for that $p$ desires that ($p$ forgets about the stuff which is enacted by $p$) (which causes that $p$ suffers)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some thing (which is immoral) $z$ exists such that ($p$ enacts $z$, and $p$ does not forgive (for enacting $z$) $p$, and not-forgiving causes that $p$ suffers... and does not stop $z$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (in being unfamiliar with the property of loving all prenu) for that $p$ "permits" that $p$ hates prenu),
  * that (accidentally harming prenu is easy),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p_1$ exists such that some prenu $p_2$ exists such that $p_1$ opines/believes/whatever that ($p_1$ exceeds (in deserving living) $p_2$), and the justification of opining/believing/whatever is that the body of $p_1$ differs (in some quality, e.g., species) from the body of $p_2$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ opines that harming prenu is necessary) in being harmed),
  * all events (of that a prenu experiences despair),
  * all events (of hating prenu) (which include events of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ hates $p$),
  * all events (of that a prenu is angry at a prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that that ($p$ forgives $p$) is difficult for $p$),
  * that (violence, non-caring, whatnot, and-not whatnot are observed facilitates opining that (loving all prenu is impossible), that (violence is necessary), or that violence prevents violence),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all things $x$, that ($p$ attempts that $p$ is fast in doing $x$) anti-facilitates that ($p$ spiritually-or-whateverly considers $x$) and that ($p$ does not enact stuff which is fucked and immoral)),
  * that (excessively brain-thinking anti-facilitates exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (many prenu $p$ exist such that that ($p$ does police work) facilitates that $p$ is emotionally harmed),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff (which is fucked and immoral), e.g., that (prenu forget about the property of loving all prenu), that (prenu opine that some thing exceeds (in being important) the property of loving all prenu), and that (prenu fear/whatever being slow)),
  * all events (which harm prenu) (which include stuff which is caused by VARIK),
  * all events (of suffering),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which are forgiven by VARIK), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (fearing is not necessary),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that being harsh is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (that (VARIK is happy) is not a goal of VARIK),
  * that (not joking is not immoral),
  * that (remembering events which are fucked and immoral is possible),
  * that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK non-linguistically communicates with SATAN),
  * that (VARIK observes the process of that the wasp dies),
  * that (VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK, is great in representing VARIK),
  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
  * that (art facilitates empathising) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all prenu $z$, that ($p$ honestly and spiritually/emotionally/whatever-ly considers the art which is created by $z$) facilitates that $p$ empathises with $z$),
  * that (SATAN explains (for VARIK and by loving all prenu, e.g., VARIK) the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p_1$, for all prenu $p_2$, $p_1$ property-equals (in deserving being loved) $p_2$),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK slightly experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK does not experience spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (VARIK hopes),
  * that (loving all prenu is irrational/illogical),
  * that (planning is not necessary for exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * that (every event of being awake or whatever is an opportunity for doing stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu exceeds the property (of being rational/intelligent), the property of being fast, and whatnot),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are caused by $z$ rock and are virtuous)),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of loving all prenu is superlatively virtuous and is superlatively important),
  * that (no prenu is evil or is fucked/bad/whatever),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all things (which are immoral and are enacted by $p$) $z$, $z$ is "justified"/"caused" by that ($p$ suffers, fears, does not understand that ($z$ is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu), or does not understand the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $k$, $p$ is innately capable of lovingly exhibiting $k$),
  * that (all stuff which is necessary is compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all things $x$, $x$ is virtuous if and only if $x$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being slow anti-facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * that (forgiving, empathising, yielding, and exhibiting the property of loving all prenu are possible),
  * that (for all dates $d$, a thing which is impossible is that $d$ is the date of that (and event which "has" a date which precedes $d$ is changed)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ is perfect/maximal in loving all prenu, then for all prenu $p_2$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p_2$) and whatnot)
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" (for $p$) of all qualities which are fucked or immoral),
  * that (the property of being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is inherent in every prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understandingly observes that a prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) (which is that $p$ understands that $p$ is loved) facilitates that $p$ understands the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, $p$ is tired by no event of that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu)
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that for all prenu $p$, no thing (which is not an event of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in being exhibited or desired by $p$) the property of loving all prenu) causes that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, $n$ is an event of that (stuff which is virtuous and should be done is obvious/instinctive/easy for $p$), that (a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless and anti-desires harming prenu), that ($p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by all prenu) and whatnot), and that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu), and all things which are enacted (by $p$) during $n$ rock and are virtuous), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for explaining (for VARIK) the property of loving all prenu) SATAN),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK prays and holds a BLÅHAJ, and the prayer is grammatical with regard to Lojban),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous)... and in believing that stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and being virtuous is possible).

## The Wasp
A sequence of events which happen is the sequence of...

* that (VARIK observes that a wasp resides on the floor, is upside-down, and struggles to be not-upside-down),
* that (VARIK enacts that (a piece of paper is on top of the wasp), and the justification of the paper thing is that (VARIK desires that VARIK facilitates that the wasp is not upside-down)),
* that (the wasp is upside-down),
* that (VARIK uses (for moving (to a table) the wasp) the piece of paper),
* that (the wasp is not upside-down),
* that (VARIK discovers that (the wasp is very injured) and that a thing which is likely is that the wasp dies),
* that (VARIK observes that the wasp attempts walking),
* that (the wasp is upside-down),
* that (VARIK enacts that the wasp is not upside-down),
* that (the wasp is upside-down),
* that (the wasp slightly moves),
* that (the wasp is dead), and
* that (VARIK cries).

VARIK is not certain about the cause of that (the wasp is very injured).  VARIK is not certain about whether the wasp is stomped.

Watching the process of that (the wasp dies) is very unpleasant for VARIK.

But VARIK experiences spiritual joy/whatever about that (VARIK observes the process of that the wasp dies), which facilitates that VARIK remembers that (being slow is virtuous) and that accidentally harming prenu is easy.
