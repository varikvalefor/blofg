* that (VARIK experiences spiritual happiness about that (a thing which is possible is that prenu increase in qualities (which are virtuous) and decrease in qualities which are immoral), that (all events of consciousness are opportunities for stuff which is virtuous), and that (determining whether stuff is virtuous is facilitated by remembering that all things which are virtuous are compatible with loving all prenu)),

## Being Tired
The morning of 20250910 is contemporaneous with that (VARIK is tired, and the extent of being tired is sufficient for that (the eyes of VARIK are focused on walls and-not whatnot, VARIK is slow in thinking, VARIK is fuckedly annoyed, and VARIK physically desires sleeping, which is mentally anti-desired by VARIK)).

But that (VARIK drinks caffeine) facilitates that VARIK decreases in being tired.

## Seeming to Not Care
Many prenu $p$ exist such that $p$ seems (to VARIK) to exhibit the property (of caring about no moral thing), i.e., the property (of that $p$ states or causes no thing (which indicates that some moral thing $m$ exists such that $p$ cares about $m$), or $p$ states or causes some thing which indicates that $p$ does not care).

VARIK experiences spiritual pain about that (many prenu seem to not care).  But VARIK believes that all prenu are (regardless of seeming to not care) capable of caring.  Additionally, VARIK understands that many prenu $p$ exist such that easy (in the event of forgetting that stuff which is virtuous is possible) is not caring.

VARIK believes that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ considers the stuff (which is important to $p$) and the reasons of importance facilitates that $p$ becomes a prenu which cares)).

## Questions
VARIK experiences spiritual hope about that (many prenu $p$ exist such that some thing (which is immoral and is acted by $p$) $z$ exists such that sending (to $p$) a question regarding $z$ facilitates that ($p$ thinks about $z$), which facilitates that $z$ is not "repeated").

## Stuff regarding Killing Prenu
For all prenu $p$, if VARIK knows that $p$ is killed, then VARIK experiences (regardless of whether VARIK opines that $p$ causes any thing which is virtuous) spiritual pain about the event of killing $p$.

Killing is immoral, and VARIK believes that for all prenu $p$, $p$ is capable of increasing (in qualities which are virtuous) and decreasing in qualities which are immoral.

VARIK experiences hope about that (things which prevent things (which are immoral) and are anti-violent are possible).  But VARIK understands that forgetting or whatever is easy.


## Stomping an Ant
VARIK attempts that VARIK kills no prenu, e.g., ants.  The justification of attempting is relevant to that (killing no prenu is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK).

But VARIK suspects that 20250910 is the date of an event (of that VARIK accidentally kills an ant), a.k.a. "$n$".

VARIK experiences spiritual pain about $n$ and intends to continue decreasing in killing things.
