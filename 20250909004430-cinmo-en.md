## Seeming to Not Care
Many prenu $p$ exist such that $p$ seems (to VARIK) to exhibit the property (of caring about no moral thing), i.e., the property (of that $p$ states or causes no thing (which indicates that some moral thing $m$ exists such that $p$ cares about $m$), or $p$ states or causes some thing which indicates that $p$ does not care).

VARIK experiences spiritual pain about that (many prenu seem to not care).  But VARIK believes that all prenu are (regardless of seeming to not care) capable of caring.  Additionally, VARIK understands that many prenu $p$ exist such that easy (in the event of forgetting that stuff which is virtuous is possible) is not caring.

VARIK believes that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ considers the stuff (which is important to $p$) and the reasons of importance facilitates that $p$ becomes a prenu which cares)).
