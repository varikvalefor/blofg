The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251225) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251225 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about event of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent, is gentle, and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event of that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ loves $p$ and understands that $p$ is loved)))),

* that (the languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of war),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences affluenza),
  * weapons,
  * all events (of that some prenu is imprisoned),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that $p$ insults $r$, and the event of insulting offends $r$ or is not an event of that $p$ attempts that $r$ is amused),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu is angry at $p$ or hates $p$) (which are events of that some prenu suffers and does not understand and facilitate that prenu increase in suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ is independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff) or that (some prenu which is not $p$ "follows" a religion which is not "followed" by $p$) or opines/whatever that (for all prenu $r$, if $r$ is religious, then $r$ attempts "religiously" controlling/manipulating prenu which are not $r$)) in that prenu attempt/whatever to "religiously" control/manipulate $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ spiritually/whatever-ly considers stuff),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts that evidence indicates that the "religion" of $p$ is correct) in fearing that $p$ believes and does not know),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that a thing which is fucked is that (some religion $r$ exists such that $p$ is the religion of $p$... and no prenu which is not $p$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that a thing which is necessary is that $p$ "follows" a religion which is not believed by $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ believes and does not know),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ attempts that ($p$ resembles prenu which are not $p$) and is not authentic to $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets about the nature/identity/self/whatever of $p$) in attempting/whatever that prenu like $p$ or are impressed/amazed by the stuff which is done by $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ does not know),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts/whatever that (prenu which are not $p$ seem to be insufficient, and $p$ seems to be sufficient)) in fearing that $p$ is insufficient),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is not authentic to $p$) (which are events of suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu, e.g., $p$, opines that (

    * some quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, or

    * $p$ is an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$, or 
    * $p$ is incapable of doing art, or

  * all events (of that some thing $z$ exists such that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ knows that ($p$ enacts $z$) and that ($z$ is fucked or immoral) and is sufficient (for that ($p$ attempts that prenu, e.g., $p$, do not understand that ($z$ is fucked or immoral) or that $p$ enacts $z$)... or that $p$ does fears that $p$ stops enacting stuff which resembles $z$) in fearing that ($p$ is punished for $z$) or the combination (of that ($p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil, and the proof is relevant to that $p$ enacts some thing which is fucked or immoral) (which is impossible) and that ($p$ understands that ($p$ enacts a thing which is fucked or immoral), and the result is that $p$ opines/whatever that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil))) (which cause (or facilitate) that (prenu increase in suffering) and that prenu continue enacting stuff which is fucked or immoral),

  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
  * that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK),

  * that (VARIK is free),
  * that (VARIK feels),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, loves VARIK... and all prenu which are not VARIK),
  * that (requesting that SATAN forgives is not necessary for that SATAN forgives),
  * that (SATAN is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * the religion (of VARIK),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to ***many*** religions), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a property which is immoral) or decreases in a property which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a property which is immoral) or decreases in a property which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK does not experience spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a property which is immoral) or decreases in a property which is virtuous)),

  * zo'e gi ga je
  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * all events (of that VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK non-slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that VARIK permits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (VARIK is not certain about the stuff which is caused by events of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu, but VARIK is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, for all things (which are caused/effected by $n$) $r$, $r$ rocks and is virtuous, and the proof is relevant to that $r$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (every event (of that VARIK whatever-ly errs) is an event of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (every event (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is an event of that VARIK is innately capable of increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
