# The Intended Purpose of la zanselfu'a jdini, a.k.a. "$F$
A thing which annoys VARIK is that (operators of chatrooms and whatnot dislike VARIK because VARIK is weird).  That (VARIK is annoyed) is a part of the justification of creating $F$, which is an I2P forum.  VARIK attempts...

* that ($F$ is not a xenophobic thing),
* that (using $F$ is easy),
* that (the rules of $F$ are virtuous),
* that (forbidden is that $F$ is used for harming prenu), and
* that ($F$ very exceeds the chatrooms and whatnot which annoy VARIK).

"http://forum.varikvalefor.i2p" is the URL of $F$.

## The Problems
A problem which is encountered in attempting to use (for discussing stuff which interests VARIK) is that (VARIK is banned from a chatroom (or whatever) $c$ because VARIK is weird).

## The Stuff which is Attempted
VARIK attempts that VARIK creates an I2P forum $x$ such that a proof of that ($x$ differs from the chatrooms and whatnot which annoy VARIK) is relevant to...

* that ($x$ is not a xenophobic thing),
* that (the rules of $x$ are virtuous),
* that ($x$ is appropriate for large discussions),
* that (using $x$ is easy), and
* that (for all prenu $p$, forbidden is using (for harming $p$) $x$).

### Being Xenophobic
Many chatrooms (or whatever) $k$ exist such that the operator of $k$ bans VARIK because (VARIK is weird (in communicating (in the third person), translating (to English and from Lojban), or desiring that (VARIK discusses things which are rarely discussed)), or the operator of $k$ assumes that the third-person communication of VARIK is role-playing.  The things which are used for justifying are not harmful, and VARIK does not opine that the things are good justifications.

Some friends (or whatever) of VARIK resemble (in using communication styles which are disliked) VARIK.

VARIK desires that an Internet forum $t$ exists such that $t$ is appropriate for the prenu (which resemble VARIK) and whatnot.

### Not Being Easily Used
Many chatrooms (or Internet forums) $k$ exist such that using $k$ is difficult for VARIK.

VARIK desires an Internet forum $t$ such that (using $t$ is easy, or using custom clients for $t$ is permitted).

### Not Having Virtuous Rules
Many chatrooms (or whatever) (which are used by VARIK) $t$ exist such that the rules of $t$ are immoral by the standard of VARIK.  A rule which exemplifies immorality is a rule which forbids sending the transgender flag.

### Not Permitting Large Discussions
Many chatrooms $t$ exist such that forbidden is sending (via $t$) text which is large.  Discord is an example.

Many things $t$ exist such that forbidding sending long messages [OPPOSITE] {ADVERB} facilitates discussing $t$.  UNIX errors are examples.

Sending spam sucks.  But false is that all text which is large and is sent via a chatroom is spam.  Additionally, for many texts $t$, compressing $t$ is easy.

### Non-Privacy
Many chatrooms $t$ exist such that forbidden is accessing (via Tor) $t$.  VARIK	dislikes forbidding using Tor.  A part of the justification of disliking is that for a prenu $p$, if the government of the state of $p$ attempts forbidding that $p$ accesses a Web site $k$, then Tor facilitates that $p$ accesses $k$.

Additionally, many chatrooms $t$ exist such that for all prenu $p$, necessary (or whatever) for that ($p$ uses $t$) is that $p$ sends (to an operator of $t$ an image which depicts an identity document of $p$.  VARIK dislikes that sending documents is necessary.  A part of the justification of disliking is that sending documents facilitates persecuting.

VARIK attempts...

* that (using (for accessing $F$) I2P or whatever is easy) and
* that (sending identity document things is not necessary for using $F$).

### Harmful Use
Many Internet forums (or whatever) $t$ exist such that the operator of $t$ allows (or encourages) that the users of $t$ insult, threaten, or stalk.  VARIK dislikes that (insulting, stalking, or threatening is permitted) because insulting, threatening, and harrassing are immoral.

VARIK attempts that for all prenu $p$, forbidden is using (for harming $p$) $F$.

## The Method of Attempting
The method of attempting is $F$, which is an Internet forum.  But using I2P necessary (or whatever) for using $F$.  The URL of the Web page regarding I2P is "https://geti2p.net".
