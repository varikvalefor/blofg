# Using (for Videos) Krita
VARIK likes that Krita facilitates creating videos regarding the process of drawing.  But VARIK dislikes that an event of using (for videos) Krita is an event of saving many JPEG (or PNG) files... and not 1 MKV (or WebM or something) file.

`img2webp(1)` facilitates converting from many images and to 1 video image, but the `img2webp(1)` thing should (per VARIK) be automatic.
