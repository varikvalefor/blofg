* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which precedes the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous)),

* that (the languages whih are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * that ((for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inherent to $p$), and VARIK is an example),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and $p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property (of loving all prenu) and all qualities which are inherent to $p$, and all qualities which are inherent to $p$ are compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is a prenu and is not an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that $p$, which is not an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$, is loved) causes that $p$ decreases in suffering),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fuckes or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which are not inherent to $p)) (which is that for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) are events of that ($p$ exhibits no quality which is fucked or immoral), and for all events $n_1$, for all events $n_2$, if $n_2$ exceeds (or equals) (in being an event of that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) $n_1$, then $n_1$ exceeds (or equals) (in being an event of that $p$ exhibits some quality which is fucked or immoral) $n_2$),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is the method of exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is tired by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu or decreases {VERB} in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
