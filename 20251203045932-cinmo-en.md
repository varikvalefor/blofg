Some part of 20251203 is an event of...

* that (VARIK excessively sleeps),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that being agender is inherent to VARIK), and that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK _slightly_ cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which precedes the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous)),

* that (the languages whih are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * that (remembering about events which are fucked or immoral is possible),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, loves VARIK),
  * that (a thing which is not necessary for that (SATAN forgives) is requesting that SATAN forgives),
  * that (SATAN is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK non-linguistically communicates with SATAN),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to ***many*** religions), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK somewhat experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a property which is immoral) or decreases in a property which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK does not experience spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a property which is immoral) or decreases in a property which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (VARIK does not control the future, and VARIK is not certain about the future),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that VARIK permits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of loving all prenu is superlatively important and is superlatively virtuous),
  * that (VARIK is not certain about the stuff which is caused by events of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu, but VARIK is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, for all things (which are caused/effected by $n$) $r$, $r$ rocks and is virtuous, and the proof is relevant to that $r$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (all events (of being harsh) and all events of attempting controlling/manipulating prenu are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu (which is not $p$) $r$ exists such that some predicate/whatever $b$ exists such that $p$ controls/forces/coerces that $r$ believes $b$)),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * that (no prenu is capable of being fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in being important and in deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
