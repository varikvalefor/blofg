===========================================================================

Some part of 20251127 is an event of...

* that (VARIK excessively sleeps),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),

  * that (all events which are preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence are events of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by events of that (some prenu (which reads the Blofg posts) $p$ exists such that $p$ understands that ($p$ is loved) and loves $p$)))),

* that (the languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences affluenza),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ feels that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil),

  * that (VARIK feels),
  * that (art facilitates empathising),
  * that (VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK are),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, loves VARIK),
  * that (SATAN is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (requesting that SATAN forgives is not necessary for that SATAN forgives),
  * that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK non-linguistically communicates with SATAN),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to ***many*** religions), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that VARIK permits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of loving all prenu is superlatively important and is superlatively virtuous),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK),
  * that (all events (which are harsh) and all events of that some prenu manipulates/controls/whatever prenu are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no thing which is fucked or immoral is necessary),
  * that (no event $n$ exists such that $n$ is an event of that some event which precedes $n$ is changed),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $k$, $p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in $k$ and the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in being important and in deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (being is sufficient),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ decreases in being important or in deserving being loved),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inherent to $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (a thing which is false is that for all actions (which are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu) $z$, $z$ is impressive/noticed/awe-inspiring/grand),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all qualities which are inherent to $p$ are compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which are not inherent to $p$)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is not necessary for that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), a.k.a. "$n$", is that ($p$ plans for $n$), attempts $n$, fears (that $n$ does not happen), or is-certain/believes/knows about the stuff which is caused by $n$),
  * that (for every prenu (which is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes that $p$ yields),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is sufficient for that language is insufficient for explaining the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu ) facilitates (or causes) that $p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu is the method of exhibiting the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being excessive in the property of loving all prenu is impossible) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for some thing which is fucked or immoral) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is "sufficient" (for that $p$ is tired by loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, every event of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu is an event (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in the property (of being important to $p$) or whatever) the property of loving all prenu) (which is an event of that $p$ does not understand)) and is a part of the proof of that fearing is not necessary),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is enacted by $p$ and during $n$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (all stuff which is virtuous and should be done is obvious/instinctive/natural/easy for $p$), that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu), that ($p$ does not fear), that ($p$ indicates that fearing is not necessary), and that (for all prenu $r$, $p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by $r$) and whatnot)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for that SATAN assists VARIK and explains (for VARIK and by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property (of loving all prenu) and for that VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK are) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and prays, and the prayer is grammatical with regard to Lojban), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is very fucked and very immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$RZ$")) and in believings that $RZ$ is possible).
