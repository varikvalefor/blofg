* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK, is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK, facilitates that VARIK assists prenu which resemble (in being transgender) VARIK, and is not a flaw),

  * that (all events (which are preceded by [THING] or the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence) are events of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which causes that (all events of that VARIK is awake/whatever which are preceded by [THING] are events of that VARIK cries) and is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (the 1st $PKS$ event precedes the events of that (VARIK is dead)), and
  * that (some prenu $p$ exists such that that ($p$ reads the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK) facilitates stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that ($p$ remembers that a thing which is not a problem is an event of that $p$ loves $p$))),

  * that (all prenu property-equal (in deserving being loved) all prenu),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (for all events $n$, a thing which is impossible is that $n$ is an event of that (an event which precedes $n$ is changed)),
  * that (learning from events (of erring) and whatnot is possible),
  * that (spiritually/whatever-ly considering the property of loving all prenu facilitates increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK),
  * that (being slow, which is facilitated by being attentive to all prenu, anti-facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * that (erring is not the end) (which is that for all prenu $p$, no event (of that $p$ errs) (which does not cause that $p$ dies) causes that $p$ is incapable of doing stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of loving all prenu is superlatively virtuous and is superlatively important),
  * that (a thing which is impossible is that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ decreases in deserving being loved) (which is that for all prenu $p$, no event causes that $p$ decreases in deserving being loved),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting),
  * that (for all prenu $p$ , the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$), which are not inherent to $p$) (which is that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu) causes that ($p$ decreases in qualities which are fucked or immoral), and every event (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is an event of that $p$ is authentic to $p$ and exhibits no quality which is fucked or immoral)),
  * that (for all prenu (which are not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ yields),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is a flaw, is fucked, or is immoral, and that for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $s$, $s$ is compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral) causes (or facilitates) that ($p$ does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral), and that ($p$ permits that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is authentic to $p$) are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all events of being awake or whatever are opportnities for exhibiting the property of loving all prenu)
  * that (planning/attempting is not necessary for being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ attempts that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) and that $p$ plans (for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) are unnecessary for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ understands about the property of loving all prenu... and decreases in suffering),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficinet (For that $p$ is tired by loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) are events (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in being important to $p) the property of loving all prenu) (which are events of that $p$ does not understand)) (which is a part of the proof of that (fearing decreasing in the property of loving all prenu is not necessary))),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff (which is enacted/caused (by $p$) during $n$) is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that ($p$ is extremely gentle with all prenu and indicates that fearing is not necessary), that ($p$ does not fear, and a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless), and that (all stuff which is virtuous and should be done by $p$ is obvious/instinctive/natural/easy for $p$)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for explaining (for VARIK and by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property of loving all prenu) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ and prays, and the prayer is small, is grammatical with regard to Lojban, and is relevant to $PKS$), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous and is hereinafter denoted by "$TZV$") and in believing that $TZV$ is possible).
