* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays and holds a BLÅHAJ), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is very fucked and very immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$ZV$")) and in believing that $ZV$ is possible).
