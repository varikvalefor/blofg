  * that (evidence is not necessary for believing),
  * that (compelling/forcing that some prenu believes is impossible),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and $p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property (of loving all prenu) and all qualities which are inherent to $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all qualities which are inherent to $p$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events of that $p$ is authentic to $p$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for every prenu (which is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes that $p$ yields),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is not necessary for that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$n$") is that ($p$ attempts $n$, plans for $n$, fears that ($n$ does not happen), or is-certain/believes/knows about the stuff which is caused by $n$)),

  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (being is sufficient),
  * that (a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is maximal in forgetting about the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that some prenu loves $p$ (which is not an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$)) causes that $p$ decreases in suffering),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is an aggregate/whatever of the stuff which is enacted by $p$),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting),

  * that (no event $n$ exists such that $n$ is an event of that some event which precedes $p$ is changed),
  * that (no thing which is fucked or immoral is necessary),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is sufficient for that language is not sufficient for defining the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (linguistically describing the property of loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which is that (the property of loving all prenu is incompatible with all things which are fucked or immoral, and (for all prenu $p$, every process (of that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu) (which begins "at" an event of that $p$ exhibits some quality which is fucked or immoral) is an event (of that $p$ decreases in some quality which is fucked or immoral), and every event of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is an event of that $p$ exhibits no quality which is fucked or immoral))),
  * that (fearing is not necessary),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is irrational/illogical),
  * that (exhibiting the the property of loving all prenu is the method of exhibiting the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
