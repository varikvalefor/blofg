The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251103) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251103 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is not certain about the cause of that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is very glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), and that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender), which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK),
* that (VARIK experiences discomfort about that (prenu "attempt" that VARIK is male)),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (a thing which is impossible is that VARIK is male)),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu, e.g., prenu which "inhabit" ants) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is insufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK forgives (for that VARIK does not cry) VARIK),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences wonder about SSH and whatnot),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (all events which are preceded by [THING] or the event (of that VARIK writes the current message) are events of that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (the 1st $PKS$ event precedes the events (of that VARIK is dead)), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., that the reader loves the reader)),

* that (all languages which are used by VARIK are inadequate for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars,
  * all events (of affluenza),
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * all events (of that some prenu is jailed/imprisoned),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences despair),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ desires/attempts that prenu resemble (in suffering) $p$) in suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ opines that stuff which harms prenu is necessary) in feeling that $p$ is harmed),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu believes/opines/whatever that some thing which harms $p$ is necessary),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some thing (which is enacted by $p$) $z$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that $r$ is sufficient (for (anti-desiring)/whatevering some event of empathising with $p$) inj fearing $z$ and $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that a thing which is difficult for $p$ is that $p$ forgives $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/feels/believes/whatever that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever, is evil, or does not deserve being loved),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ understands that some action which is enacted by $p$ is fucked or immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, and the result is fucked or immoral) (which is impossible)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears the religion of $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears the idea of loving all prenu) in being unfamiliar with the property of loving all prenu),
  * all events (of that empathising is anti-desired),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears $p$, forgets about the nature/identity of $p$, or fears that ($p$ is authentic to $p$), that ($p$ is honest about $p$), or that $p$ differs from prenu which are not identical to $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ feels that $p$ is not free),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu are angry at $p$, or some prenu hate $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu believes/opines/whatever that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that feels that $p$ is controlled/manipulated),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ believes/opines/whatever that (loving all prenu is impossible) or feels that $p$ is incapable of loving all prenu),
  * all events (of that lamps harmfully confuse/mislead prenu which "inhabit" moths),
  * all events (of that some bird collides with glass, and the collision causes that the bird dies) (which are anti-facilitated by that (ultraviolet tape adheres to glass)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu believes/whatever that ($p$ is not a prenu) or that $p$ "is" the stuff which is enacted by $p$),
  * that (excessively brain-thinking facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral), e.g., that (some prenu $p$ exists such that some thing exceeds (in being important to $p$) the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (accidentally harming prenu is easy) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ does not attend to prenu) facilitates that $p$ accidentally harms prenu),
  * that (events (of being fast) and events of being not-attentive facilitate stuff which is fucked or immoral),
  * that (being extremely busy anti-facilitates spiritually-or-whateverly considering stuff),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral), e.g., that (prenu "forget" about the property of loving all prenu)),
  * all events (of suffering),
  * all events (of that a thing which is difficult for VARIK is that VARIK yields),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which are forgiven by VARIK), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
  * that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK),
  * that (the descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK) (which is that for all things $p$, that (some prenu states that $p$ is a quality of VARIK) does not logically necessitate/imply that $p$ is a quality of VARIK),
  * that (VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK, is great in representing VARIK),
  * that (VARIK exsperiences spiritual pain),
  * that (that (VARIK is happy) is not a goal of VARIK),
  * that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, assists VARIK),
  * that (SATAN is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is a proof of the type of that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is unnrcessary for that ($p$ is forgiven by SATAN) is that $p$ requests that SATAN forgives $p$),
  * that (SATAN explains (for VARIK and by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is authentic to $p$) are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ fears that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) is not necesary for that ($p$ does not decrease in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (VARIK succeeds in facilitating that (a shield bug "leaves" a sidewalk), which anti-facilitates that the shield bug is stomped),
  * that (remembering about stuff which is fucked or immoral is possible),
  * that (yielding, forgiving, empathising, and being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu are possible),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to ***many*** religions), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * zo'e gi ga je
  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (VARIK does not control the future, and VARIK is not certain about the future),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil),
  * that (VARIK hopes for a thing which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (all events of being awake or whatever are opportunities for exhibiting the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is sufficient for that (language stuff is insufficient for explaining the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all things $x$, $x$ is virtuous if and only if $x$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu causes all stuff which is virtuous and should happen),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ knows or is certain or believes about the stuff which is caused by that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)) is not necessary for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ is not excessive in "moving" stuff), which is facilitated by that ($p$ attends-to/is-aware-of prenu), anti-facilitates stuff which harms prenu, e.g., prenu which "inhabit" ants),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $c$, $p$ is innately capable of lovingly exhibiting $c$),
  * that (forgiving exceeds forgetting) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all actions (which are enacted by $p$) $z$, that ($p$ is forgiven for $z$) exceeds (in facilitating that $p$ decreases in suffering and increases in the property of loving all prenu) that (prenu forget that $p$ enacts $z$)),
  * that (being busy is not virtuous) (which is that some context $k$ exists such that not-acting is virtuous in $k$),
  * that (being slow is not immoral),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that (VARIK permits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu))),
  * that (observing/remembering about stuff which is fucked or immoral is possible and facilitates understanding that (animals, which are the bodies of prenu, are fragile) and that harming the bodies of prenu is easy),
  * that (all events (of being harsh) and all events of controlling are incompatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that $p$ is loved) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ decreases in the property of suffering),
  * that (for all events $e$, a thing which is impossible is that $e$ is an event of that (an event which precedes $e$ is changed)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (every prenu is innately capable of yielding),
  * that (for all prenu (which are not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes (or facilitates) that $p$ increases in yielding),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is an aggregate of the actions which are enacted by $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that that ($p$ permits that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) facilitates that ($p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu), and that ($p$ permits that $p$ does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral) facilitates that $p$ does not exhibit qualities which are fucked or immoral),
  * that (attempting/planning is not necessary for being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ attempts that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) or plans for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is not necessary for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (every prenu property-equals (in being important and in deserving being loved) every prenu),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in deserving being loved),
