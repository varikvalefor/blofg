# The Image which Depicts Resembling HUNTER S. THOMPSON, a.k.a. "$t$"
VARIK considers drawing that VUNC resembles $t$ and occupies a beach or whatever.  The image depicts all parts (of the body of VUNC) which should be seen.  Parts of the justification of considering are that (VARIK desires that VARIK becomes a thing which is capable of drawing rayon and sand) and that VARIK desires that VARIK desires that VARIK draws a thing which indicates that VARIK is weird.  But that VARIK is weird is obvious.

A thing which is possible is that VARIK should draw that (the body of VUNC is in front of a depiction (of a beach thing) which is large), which indicates that VARIK dislikes the fake stuff.  VARIK increases in disliking the fake stuff.
