## Failing to Not Sleep
The morning of 20251020 is contemporaneous with that (VARIK attempts that VARIK does not sleep).

But VARIK reclines, holds a BLÅHAJ, prays, and does not drink a large quantity of caffeine.  The situation, a.k.a. "$P$", facilitates that VARIK sleeps.

VARIK fails to not sleep.  But VARIK is not late.

$P$ slightly amuses VARIK.
