The Emotions (which are Experienced (during 20250810) by VARIK) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the translation source for the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

that (VARIK is tired, and the cause of the tiredness is that 20250810010000 is the approximate date/time of that VARIK stops sleeping),
* that (thinking is somewhat difficult for VARIK, and the cause of difficulty is that VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK suggests creating backups of stuff which is important),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad (or whatever) about that VARIK is transgender),
* that (VARIK desires that (VARIK understands the reason for that (a prenu (which uses a chatroom which is used by VARIK) insults and does whatnot)) because VARIK desires that VARIK assists),
* that VARIK somewhat cries,
* that (VARIK attempts to determine/discover stuff which facilitates that VARIK becomes a vegan),
* that ("Hold Tight London", which is created by The Chemical Brothers and is very familiar to VARIK, is semantically/meaningfully beautiful to VARIK, and VARIK suggests that the reader listens (or whatever {VERB}) to "Hold Tight London"),
* that (VARIK struggles to attain that (VARIK extremely desires (and attempts) that (the stuff which is immoral is stopped) but is angry at no prenu)),
* that (VARIK is slightly amused by that (frequent is that (VARIK is angry at VARIK... because VARIK is angry or whatever))),
* that (VARIK requests that (SATAN assists with that VARIK increases (in all qualities which are virtuous) and decreases (in all qualities which are immoral)) and that (prenu which are not SATAN inform (about things which are caused by VARIK and are immoral) VARIK), which facilitates that VARIK increases and decreases), and
* that VARIK does not expect but _extremely_ hopes for stuff which rocks and is virtuous.

## Stuff which Facilitates Becoming Vegan
The intersection of the set (which only contains all events $x$ such that VARIK opines that $x$ facilitates that VARIK becomes a vegan) and the set (which only contains all events $x$ such that $x$ is possible) includes...

* that (VARIK becomes a thing which is digusted by meat and whatnot),
* that (VARIK discovers food which is vegan and cheap),
* that (VARIK discovers food which is vegan and is liked by VARIK), and
* that VARIK discovers food which exhibits the property (of being tasteless), which facilitates that VARIK does not excessively eat.

## That (Difficult is that VARIK Desires and is Not Angry)
Many things $t$ exhibit the property of that ($t$ is sufficiently immoral such that VARIK should (per VARIK) desire (and attempt) that (VARIK stops $t$), and VARIK is angry at the prenu which causes $t$), a.k.a. "$c$".

Examples of things which exhibit $c$ include events of that (prenu are kidnapped and "moved" to neglect-or-abuse buildings).

A thing which facilitates that (a thing decreases in being angry and increases in caring and desiring (and attempting) to stop stuff which is immoral) is that a thing empathises.

VARIK requests (from SATAN) that SATAN assists with that VARIK increases in empathising with all prenu.
