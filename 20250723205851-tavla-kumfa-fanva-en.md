# Sending (via Chatrooms) Translation Sources
Many chatrooms $t$ exist such that VARIK sends(via $t$) English translations and translation sources.  Parts of the justification of sending translations and translation sources are that (VARIK desires that a thing indicates that VARIK translates) and that (VARIK desires that easy for VARIK is "improving" the translations which are written by VARIK).

But many chatrooms $t$ exist such that an operator of $t$ requests that VARIK does not send translation sources.  But frequent is that VARIK disobeys.  A part of the justification of disobeying is that VARIK suspects that if sending translation sources is annoying, then third-person communication is annoying.  Many prenu are angry with VARIK because VARIK writes in the third person.

VARIK very thanks the prenu which operate chatrooms and tolerate VARIK.
