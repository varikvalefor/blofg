# Automatic Translator
VARIK desires that (a thing automatically translates (to English and from Lojban) the stuff which is written by VARIK) and that the result of translation rocks in being appropriate with regard to the translation source.

VARIK desires that VARIK expresses stuff which is virtuous... and not that VARIK very writes.  That (VARIK typos stuff) and whatnot are frequent.
