========================================================================================

Some part of 20251231 or 20260101 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender, and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK _slightly_ experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK experiences wonder about that computers are not perfectly broken/inoperable),
* that (VARIK forgets to use the eyeglasses of VARIK),
* that (VARIK is amused about that VARIK forgets to use the eyeglasses of VARIK),
* that (VARIK is somewhat annoyed by stuff which is communicated by prenu) (which is fucked and is that VARIK is excessively annoyed),
* that (VARIK is not annoyed),
* that (VARIK is bored by the process of non-automatically-assistedly translating to English and from Lojban),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous))),

* that (all languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of war),
  * weapons,
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu is angry at $p$ or hates $p$) (which are events of that (prenu suffer and do not understand) and cause/facilitate that prenu increase in suffering),

  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ is independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff) or that (some prenu which is not $p$ "follows" a religion which is not "followed" by $p$) or opines/whatever that (for all prenu $r$, if $r$ is religious, then $r$ attempts "religiously" controlling/manipulating prenu which are not $r$)) in that prenu attempt/whatever to "religiously" control/manipulate $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts that evidence indicates that the "religion" of $p$ is correct) in fearing that $p$ believes and does not know),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that ($p$ is aware of things $z$ such that $p$ disagrees with $z$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that (every hypothetical event (of that $p$ "follows" a religion which is "followed" by no prenu which is known by $p$ and is not $p$) is fucked or immoral)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ religiously/whatever-ly considers stuff),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets about the nature/identity/self/whatever of $p$) in attempting/whatever that prenu like $p$ or are impressed/amazed by the stuff which is done by $p$),

  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (empathising (in suffering and whatnot) (with all prenu), remembering about events which are fucked or immoral, and being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu are possible),
  * that (VARIK is VARIK),
