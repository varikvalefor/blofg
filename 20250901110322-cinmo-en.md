## Not Being Extremely Angry
That (VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence) is contemporaneous with that VARIK exhibits the property (of that sadness-or-whatever, which is not very experienced by VARIK), a.k.a. "$K$".

VARIK is glad about exhibiting $K$.  Anger exceeds (in facilitating mistreating and not in facilitating "improving") sadness-or-whatever.

VARIK hopes that that (VARIK exhibits $K$, or that destruction emotions are exceeded in being experienced) continues.

## Being Tired
That (VARIK is tired) is contemporaneous with writing the translation source of the current sentence.

VARIK suspects that the cause of tiredness is that (that (VARIK awakens) almost immediately precedes that (VARIK writes the translation source), and VARIK is slow in becoming a thing which is very alert).
