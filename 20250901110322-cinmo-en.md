===========================================================================

* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK somewhat struggles to describe the emotions which are experienced by VARIK),
* that (VARIK considers creating a list of questions which facilitate discovering descriptions of emotion which are great),
* that (VARIK is glad about being agender and acknowledges that (if VARIK is not agender, then VARIK is not VARIK))
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about Lojban, which is very appropriate for descriptions (of the emotions which are experienced by VARIK) and whatnot),
* that (sadness-or-whatever, which is not very experienced, exceeds (in being experienced by VARIK) anger, and VARIK is glad about exceeding),
* that (VARIK experiences wonder about that (birds which sing stuff which interests VARIK are the product of evolution or whatever)),
* that (VARIK attempts translating (to Lojban and from English) "PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM" and attempts all things which are necessary for translating),
* that (VARIK intends to "convert" (to JPEG files or JPEG XL files) CR3 images which deopict bees or moths),
* that (VARIK welcomes sending questions regarding the blofg posts (which are made by VARIK) or whatever),
* that (VARIK attempts (via sending or stating) that prenu remember-or-whatever that (false is that all events of failure prevent succeeding), that (attempting is possible), that (learning (about causes of failing) via failing is possible), that (experiencing emotion is not a flaw), and that describing emotions which are experienced is not a flaw),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about many things (which are caused by VARIK) and many things which are not caused by VARIK),

* that (VARIK very attempts $T$, struggles with $T$, and suspects that all prenu which attempt are familiar with that (increasing in stuff which is virtuous is difficult)), and
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) but very hopes for stuff which is extreme in being virtuous and in rocking).

## Gender Dysphoria
20250901 is the date of that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria) and that (VARIK is glad about that ("somewhat" applies) but desires decreasing in experiencing gender dysphoria).

But 20250902 exceeds (in being a date of that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria)) 20250901.  But 20250902 is not a date of that (VARIK very extremely experiences gender dysphoria).  VARIK is glad (or whatever) about that (the thing is not very extreme).

## Not Being Extremely Angry
That (VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence) is contemporaneous with that VARIK exhibits the property (of that sadness-or-whatever, which is not very experienced by VARIK), a.k.a. "$K$".

VARIK is glad about exhibiting $K$.  Anger exceeds (in facilitating mistreating and not in facilitating "improving") sadness-or-whatever.

VARIK hopes that that (VARIK exhibits $K$, or that destruction emotions are exceeded in being experienced) continues.

## Being Tired
That (VARIK is tired) is contemporaneous with writing the translation source of the current sentence.

VARIK suspects that the cause of tiredness is that (that (VARIK awakens) almost immediately precedes that (VARIK writes the translation source), and VARIK is slow in becoming a thing which is very alert).

## Subjects of Spiritual Pain
VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

* all wars,
* fascism,
* that (for many prenu $p$, political stuff exceeds (in being "important" to $p$) anti-violence),
* all events (of revenge),
* that (prenu, e.g., VARIK, are angry at prenu),
* that (VARIK, which thanks (for assisting) SATAN, is excessive (or whatever) in being slow in increasing (in all qualities which are virtuous) and decreasing in all qualities which are immoral),
* that (some prenu (use for harming prenu) religion),
* that (many prenu believe (or whatever) that violence prevents violence),
* that (prenu, e.g., prenu which immigrate, prenu which are queer, and prenu which "follow" religions which are weird, are mistreated/abused),
* that (some prenu believe that some prenu are bad/worthless/fucked),
* that (for many prenu $p$, the emotions of prenu which are not $p$ are not important to $p$),
* that (for many prenu $p$, $p$ easily attempts (or whatever) that $p$ becomes a prenu which believes that (errors which are caused by $p$ are _not_ errors), which anti-facilitates improving),
* that (for many prenu $p$, easy for $p$ is that ($p$ becomes a prenu (which resembles a prenu which mistreats $p$ and whatnot), and the justification is relevant to that ($p$ experiences pain))),
* that (difficult (for prenu which are not familiar with the thing) is becoming a prenu which believes that improving, things which are virtuous, and things which rock are possible),
* that (many prenu believe that some prenu are not prenu),
* that (some prenu mistreat prenu, and the justification of mistreating is that the thing amuses),
* that (for many things (which are immoral) $t$, VARIK knows that ($t$ is immoral) but does not know about a method of stopping $t$),
* that (for many prenu $p$, for some thing (which is capable of suffering $s$), $p$ does not know that (extraterrestrials exist), and $p$ knows that ($s$ exists), and feasible for $p$ is attempting to decrease (in suffering) $s$, but extraterrestrials exceed (in being kindly attended by $p$) $s$),
* that (a thing which is frequent is that (VARIK sarcastically responds to prenu which state things which annoy VARIK)),
* that (caring exceeds (in being difficult) not caring),
* that (for many prenu $p$, $p$ desires that a prenu which is not $p$ dies),
* that (for many prenu $p$, $p$ celebrates that a prenu which is not $p$ and is disliked by $p$ dies),
* that (hating prenu is very easy),
* that (many things which are virtuous exceed (in being difficult) many things which are immoral),
* that (a thing which is frequent is that forgiving is difficult), and
* that (many prenu $p$ exist such that $p$ seems (to VARIK) to exhibit the property of that (no thing $n$ exists such that $p$ cares about $n$)).
