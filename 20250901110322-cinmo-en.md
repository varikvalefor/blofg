## Gender Dysphoria
20250901 is the date of that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria) and that (VARIK is glad about that ("somewhat" applies) but desires decreasing in experiencing gender dysphoria).

But 20250902 exceeds (in being a date of that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria)) 20250901.  But 20250902 is not a date of that (VARIK very extremely experiences gender dysphoria).  VARIK is glad (or whatever) about that (the thing is not very extreme).

## Not Being Extremely Angry
That (VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence) is contemporaneous with that VARIK exhibits the property (of that sadness-or-whatever, which is not very experienced by VARIK), a.k.a. "$K$".

VARIK is glad about exhibiting $K$.  Anger exceeds (in facilitating mistreating and not in facilitating "improving") sadness-or-whatever.

VARIK hopes that that (VARIK exhibits $K$, or that destruction emotions are exceeded in being experienced) continues.

## Being Tired
That (VARIK is tired) is contemporaneous with writing the translation source of the current sentence.

VARIK suspects that the cause of tiredness is that (that (VARIK awakens) almost immediately precedes that (VARIK writes the translation source), and VARIK is slow in becoming a thing which is very alert).

## Subjects of Spiritual Pain

* that (for many prenu $p$, for some thing (which is capable of suffering $s$), $p$ does not know that (extraterrestrials exist), and $p$ knows that ($s$ exists), and feasible for $p$ is attempting to decrease (in suffering) $s$, but extraterrestrials exceed (in being kindly attended by $p$) $s$),
* that (a thing which is frequent is that (VARIK sarcastically responds to prenu which state things which annoy VARIK)), and
* that (many prenu $p$ exist such that $p$ seems (to VARIK) to exhibit the property of that (no thing $n$ exists such that $p$ cares about $n$)).
