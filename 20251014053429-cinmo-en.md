===========================================================================

Soem part of 20251014 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK knows that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) and that VARIK knows that VARIK is transgender),
* that (VARIK is glad about the fursona (of VARIK), which is great in representing VARIK, "has" a body which resembles the agender flag, and facilitates remembering that (being transgender is not a flaw) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK consumes a large amount of caffeine),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu), which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK not-slightly-and-not-extremely cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which is virtuous, e.g., that (a prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ forgives $p$)),
  * that (all events which are preceded by [THING] are events (of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which are events of that VARIK feels the suffering which is experienced by all prenu)), and
  * that (that (VARIK is extreme in assisting all prenu) precedes that VARIK dies)),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars,
  * that (many prenu $p$ exist such that ($p$ does not forgive $p$, and that ($p$ does not forgive $p$) causes that ($p$ attempts not experiencing emotion or whatever), which facilitates that ($p$ causes stuff $s$ such that forgiving (for $s$) $p$ is difficult for $p$))),
  * that (many prenu (which are familiar with competition, whatnot, and-not whatnot) $p$ exist such that yielding is difficult for $p$),
  * that (some prenu $p$ exists such that ($p$ permits that (a thing which is fucked and immoral continues), and the "justification" of permitting is that ($p$ anti-desires that ($p$ understands that the thing is fucked and immoral)), and the justification of anti-desiring is that ($p$ believes that $p$ is incapable of forgiving $p$))) (which is fucked and immoral, is an event of suffering, and is prevented by loving all prenu),
  * that (many prenu $p$ exist such that that ($p$ is familiar with competing, whatnot, and-not whatnot) facilitates that $p$ is annoyed or experiences anger),
  * that (many prenu (which do not believe about the property of loving all prenu) $p$ exist such that mistreating $p$ facilitates that ($p$ hates) (which is that ($p$ suffers) and is fucked and immoral)),
  * all events (of hating prenu),
  * all events (of anti-desiring empathising),
  * that (observing wars, whatnot, and-not whatnot facilitates opining that (loving all prenu is impossible) or that some prenu is evil),
  * all events (of that $p$ is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (forgiving and whatnot are anti-familiar to many prenu which inhabit competitive society),
  * that (many prenu $p$ exist such that forgiving $p$ is difficult for $p$),
  * that (competitive society facilitates forgetting (about the property of loving all prenu), that (honety is feared), and that (waiting (for determining whether an action which is considered is virtuous) is feared)), and
  * that (many jokes are "just"/"merely" insults)),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual amusement about...

  * that (many events (of that VARIK prays) are events of that VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ)),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (art facilitates empathising),
  * that (some jokes are virtuous),
  * that (loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to _many_ religions), and
  * that (all violence and whatnot is incompatible with loving all prenu)),

* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK decreases (in a quality which is virtuous) or increases in a quality which is immoral)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that a thing which is impossible is that a prenu is sufficient (for not loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no prenu is evil or fucked/bad/whatever),
  * that (changing past events is impossible, and learning from past events is possible) (which is that for all dates $d_1$, for all dates (which exceed $d_1$) $d_2$, for all events (which are dated on $d_1$) $e$, that ($d_2$ is the date of that $e$ is changed) is impossible, and that ($d_2$ is a date of learning from $e$) is possible),
  * that (loving all prenu is the "cure"),
  * that (loving all prenu prevents decreasing (in qualities which are virtuous) and increasing in qualities which are immoral),
  * that (all qualities which are fucked or immoral are inherent to _no_ prenu),
  * that (all things (which are caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) are rocking and virtuous),
  * that (loving all prenu justifies not fearing),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of loving all prenu is superlative in the property (of being virtuous) (which is the property of being compatible with loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all things $z$, a thing which is possible is that that ($p$ pauses and determines whether $z$ is virtuous) precedes that ($p$ enacts $z$)),
  * that (yielding is possible and facilitates (or causes) increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the universal explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (many prenu forget about the property of loving all prenu, but all prenu are capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is (regardless of whether $p$ remembers about the property of loving all prenu) innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that the property of being capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is inherent to all prenu)),
  * that (no thing causes that a prenu is not capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, are capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all events which are enacted (during $n$) by $p$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (stuff which is virtuous and should be done is obvious/instinctive/easy for $p$)),
  * that (all violence and whatnot is incompatible with the property of loving all prenu), and
  * that (all events of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu are events of being extremely gentle)),

* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK prays and holds a BLÅHAJ, and the prayer is grammatical with regard to Lojban),
* that (VARIK thanks (for facilitating that VARIK understands the property of loving all prenu and increases in the property of loving all prenu) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (all events which are preceded by [THING] are events of that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu))), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) but is extremely extreme in hoping for stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous).

## Spiritual Fear/Whatever
A thing which is frequent or whatever is that VARIK experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous).

But stuff which facilitates that VARIK decreases in experiencing spiritual fear/whatever includes that (VARIK spiritually considers that (learning from mistakes is possible), that (loving all prenu is the "cure" of all stuff which is fucked and immoral, e.g., anger for prenu), and that (VARIK is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)... and yields).

VARIK believes that the property of loving all prenu is "immune".  Many events of empathising are events of understanding justifications and are not events of desiring that stuff which is fucked and immoral continues.

Experiencing spiritual fear/whatever is not necessary.
Experiencing spiritual fear/whatever is not beneficial.

But VARIK forgives (for experiencing spiritual fear/whatever) VARIK.
