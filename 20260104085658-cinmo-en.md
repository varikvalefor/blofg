=======================================================================================

Some part of 20260104 or 20260105 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender, and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events (of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent, is gentle, and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK is somewhat annoyed) (which is that VARIK is excessively annoyed),
* that (VARIK is not annoyed),
* that (VARIK somewhat desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event of that some prenu (which reads the current sentence) $p$ exists and loves $p$))),

* that (all languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts/whatever that ($p$ does not understand (or know) that $p$ exhibits a quality which is fucked or immoral) (which anti-facilitates that ($p$ increases/improves) and facilitates that $p$ increases in suffering)) in fearing that $p$ exhibits some quality (which is fucked or immoral) (which is not inherent to $p$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/whatever that every event (of that $p$ "follows" some religion $r$ such that $p$ does not know that some prenu which is not $p$ "follows" $r$) is fucked or immoral),
