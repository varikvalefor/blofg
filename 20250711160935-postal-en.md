# That (_POSTAL_ is Beautifully Fucked)
The 1st _POSTAL_ game, a.k.a. "$P_1$", is beautiful to VARIK.  The beauty property is facilitating empathising (with prenu which cause terrible things), which is virtuous and is necessary (or whatever) for preventing violence.

Playing $P_1$ is very unpleasant for VARIK.  But a thing which continues is that VARIK very likes $P_1$.
Empathising is understanding.  But many events of understanding are events of disagreeing.

"Playing violent video games regarding violence is fucked" is false.  But forgetting that the violent video games regarding violence are video games _is_ fucked.
But video games regarding violence resemble videos.  The resemblance property is facilitating that the observer empathises with the agent which causes harm.  But necessary is remembering that (the events are fucked)... and that a thing which is not necessary is that the things are repeated or whatever.

The thing is extremely unpleasant for VARIK.  But VARIK extremely recommends playing $P_1$.
