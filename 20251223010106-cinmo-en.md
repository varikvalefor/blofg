=======================================================================================

Some part of 20251223 or 20251224 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that VARIK understands that VARIK is agender, and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events (of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK accompanies and observes the process of that an insect dies),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exemplified by an event of that (some prenu (which reads the current sentence) $p$ exists such that $p$ loves $p$ and understands that $p$ is loved)))),

* that (VARIK thanks (for assisting VARIK, for explaining (for VARIK and by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), and for that (VARIK feels) and that VARIK and prenu which are not VARIK are) SATAN),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ, non-linguistically prays, and slightly cries),
* that (VARIK holds a BLÅHAJ, prays, and slightly cries, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$TZV$")) and in believing that $TZV$ is possible).
