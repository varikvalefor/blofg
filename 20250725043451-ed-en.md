# `ed(1)`
VARIK likes `ed(1)`.  The proof of liking is relevant to...

* that (`ed(1)` is simple) and
* that (`ed(1)` is appropriate for slow links, which are bad fits for `vi(1)` and whatnot).

But that (VARIK uses `ed(1)`) is not very frequent.  Possible is that a part of the cause of not being frequent is that (frequent is that VARIK errs in typing)... or that (necessary (or whatever) for using the "`s`" command is counting, and VARIK is slow in counting).

But VARIK very suggests that all prenu which use UNIX are familiar with `ed(1)`.
