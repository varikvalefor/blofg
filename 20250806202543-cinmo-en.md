Emotions or Whatever
====================

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is not dead),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by that (difficult for VARIK is that (VARIK "updates" the proofs which are defined by VARIK such that the definitions of the proofs are compatible with the new version of Agda)) and resumes that (VARIK uses a version (of Agda) $a$ such that unnecessary for $a$ is "updating" the proofs)),
* that (VARIK experiences discomfort/pain/whatever about that (VARIK is very slow in creating a video (regarding the process of drawing), which is not promised)),
* that (something happens, or VARIK is somewhat angry at prenu (which do things (which are easy) and-not things which are virtuous), and being angry is fucked... and is not necessary for facilitating improving, but possible is that VARIK decreases in being angry),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria, but VARIK likes that "somewhat" and-not "extremely" applies),
* that (VARIK fears (or whatever) that society increases in mistreating prenu (which are transgender) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK desires and requests that SATAN assists (in increasing in doing stuff which is virtuous) VARIK),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries), and
* that VARIK does not expect but extremely hopes.

Additionally, for all prenu $p$, VARIK requests that $p$ attempts stuff which is virtuous.

## Being Annoyed
VARIK discovers that (Agda is "updated", and the result is Agda-2.8.0).

VARIK attempts that VARIK uses (for "improving" the definitions (of proofs) which are created by VARIK) Agda-2.8.0.

VARIK discovers that Agda-2.8.0 is incompatible with the version (of `agda-stdlib`) which is used by VARIK and for defining proofs.

VARIK is annoyed by that (necessary (or whatever) for using Agda-2.8.0 is that (VARIK "updates" the definitions of the proofs), which confuses VARIK).

VARIK chooses to return to using Agda-2.7.0.1.

## Fear or Whatever
VARIK is transgender; VARIK is agender.  VARIK fears (or whatever {VERB})...

* that (many prenu increase in fearing/hating prenu which are transgender or differently weird),
* that (society "increases" in attempting that for all prenu (which are transgender or weird) $p$, that ($p$ is transgender or weird) is a secret of $p$, or $p$ commits a crime), and
* that (society "increases" in permitting mistreatment of prenu which are transgender or weird).

## Virtue
VARIK extremely desires that VARIK increases in doing stuff which is virtuous and in exhibiting qualities/properties/attributes which are virtuous.  Some examples of things which are virtuous are...

* the property (of hating no prenu),
* the property (of stopping stuff which is immoral),
* the property (of causing nothing which is immoral),
* the property (of being angry with no prenu),
* that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK does whatever or attempts that VARIK assists (in stuff which is virtuous) $p$),
* that (for no prenu $p$, VARIK caues a thing which harms $p$), and
* the property of empathising with all prenu.

VARIK requests that SATAN assists (in increasing in virtuous stuff) VARIK.  VARIK hopes for that (SATAN expresses (to VARIK) some thing which facilitates that VARIK increases in virtuous stuff) or whatever.

## Desiring Crying
VARIK desires that VARIK cries about...

* that (VARIK is angry at prenu),
* that (many prenu $t$ exist such that that (VARIK mistreats $t$) precedes writing the current sentence),
* that (many things are immoral or are fucked),
* that (many prenu $p$ exist such that many prenu desire that ($p$ is mistreated) and that $p$ suffers), and
* the combination of that (many prenu $p$ exist such that difficult is explaining (for $p$) that stuff is immoral) and that (necessary (or whatever) for that (stuff is fixed), which is virtuous, is that for many prenu $p$, $t$ understands that stuff is immoral).

Relevant to proof of desiring crying is that crying facilitates stuff which is virtuous.

## Hope
Stuff is fucked in...

* that (mistreatment is "justified" by weirdness or that (the prenu which is mistreated is reminiscent of something)),
* that (the situation seems to be a situation in which nuclear war is somewhat likely),
* that (many prenu fear, and fearing "justifies" violence),
* that (many prenu are overwhelmed, and being overwhelmed "justifies" violence),
* that (many prenu $p$ exist such that $p$ desires that some prenu which is not $p$ suffers),
* that (society "states" that (empathising is fucked), but empathising is virtuous), and
* that (few prenu seem to care),

and VARIK expects that stuff "increases" in being fucked.

But VARIK _extremely_ hopes for that (stuff "decreases" in being fucked), a.k.a. "$T$".  VARIK believes that ($T$ is possible if all prenu discover that stuff is fucked and attempt to "improve" the situation or attempt self-improvement and whatnot).
