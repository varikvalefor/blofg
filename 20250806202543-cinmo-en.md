That (VARIK writes the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is not dead),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by that (difficult for VARIK is that (VARIK "updates" the proofs which are defined by VARIK such that the definitions of the proofs are compatible with the new version of Agda)) and resumes that (VARIK uses a version (of Agda) $a$ such that unnecessary for $a$ is "updating" the proofs)),
* that (VARIK experiences discomfort/pain/whatever about that (VARIK is very slow in creating a video (regarding the process of drawing), which is not promised)),
* that (something happens, or VARIK is somewhat angry at prenu (which do things (which are easy) and-not things which are virtuous), and being angry is fucked... and is not necessary for facilitating improving, but possible is that VARIK decreases in being angry),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria, but VARIK likes that "somewhat" and-not "extremely" applies),
* that (VARIK fears (or whatever) that society increases in mistreating prenu which are transgender),
* that (VARIK desires and requests that SATAN assists (in increasing in doing stuff which is virtuous) VARIK),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries), and
* that VARIK does not expect but extremely hopes.

Additionally, for all prenu $p$, VARIK requests that $p$ attempts stuff which is virtuous.
