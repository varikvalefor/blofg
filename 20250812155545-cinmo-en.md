The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250812) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is somewhat tired, and the cause of tiredness is that VARIK insufficiently sleeps),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK does not extremely experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK "improves" Scrapple and the Agda definition of Classic MCELIECE... and "improves" la cukta and whatnot),
* that (VARIK experiences mental discomfort/pain/(complaint emotion) about that infeasible is that VARIK "completes"/"perfects" all things which are created by VARIK),
* that (VARIK considers "adding" (to la ti'ocku, which is the religious book of the religion of VARIK) a thing which indicates that (for all things (which are virtuous) $t$, all things which are logically necessitated by $t$ are virtuous) or whatever),
* that (VARIK cries about that ("That Special Someone" of _Grand Theft Auto IV_ is very beautiful to VARIK)),
* that (VARIK attempts to determine/discover a thing which harms no prenu and is an act of preventing stuff which is immoral),
* that (VARIK attempts to discover a great explanation (for prenu which are not familiar) of that (stuff is immoral) and that stuff which is virtuous is possible),
* that (VARIK describes the proof of that VARIK publicly describes the emotions which are experienced by VARIK),
* that (VARIK suggests resembling (in describing (for all prenu which are attentive) emotions) VARIK),
* that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK requests that $p$ considers whether ($p$ does stuff which is virtuous) and the goals of the actions of $p$ and remembers that doing stuff which is virtuous and weird is possible),
* that (VARIK fears (or whatever {VERB}) that (VARIK decreases in doing stuff (which is virtuous)... or increases in stuff which is immoral), a.k.a. "$f$", and hopes and attempts that VARIK prevents $f$),
* that (VARIK requests that (SATAN assists with that VARIK increases in all things which are virtuous and decreases in all things which are immoral)... and sarcastically states that possible is that SATAN is annoyed by that VARIK is extreme in requesting),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain/sadness/(complaint emotion) about that (some prenu $p$ exist such that $p$ is a theist and believes that the ggod of $p$ is not perfect (or whatever) in doing stuff which is virtuous)), and
* that VARIK expects stuff (which is fucked and immoral)... but is extreme in hoping for stuff which rocks and is virtuous and in believing that stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible.

## Being Tired
The night of 20250811 and 20250812 is an event (of that VARIK insufficiently sleeps), and the result of insufficiently sleeping is that VARIK is not naturally un-tired.  Additionally, the night of 20250712 and 20250813 is similar.

VARIK desires that sleeping is not necessary.  But VARIK knows that sleeping _is_ necessary.

VARIK whinges about that (that (VARIK is tired) anti-facilitates stuff (which is virtuous) and causes that VARIK is slow).  But VARIK is glad about that (caffeine facilitates increasing in being un-tired).

## la ti'ocku
VARIK considers "adding" (to la ti'ocku, which is a religious book, describes or defines the religion of VARIK, and is written by VARIK) a thing which indicates that (for all things (which are virtuous) $v$, virtuous are all things which are logically necessitated/entailed/implied by $v$), that (for all things (which are virtuous) $v$, vituous are all things which are directly/physically/inherently caused by $v$), or whatever.

But VARIK is not certain about a definition (of the belief) which rocks.

VARIK attempts that VARIK discovers a definition which rocks.  VARIK intends that (if VARIK discovers a definition which rocks abnd is certain that the thing is true, then VARIK "adds" (to la ti'ocku) the definition).

## Describing Emotion
VARIK exhibits the property (of that VARIK describes (for all prenu which are willing and attentive) the emotions which are experienced by VARIK), a.k.a. "$c$", and opines that $c$ facilitates that VARIK increases in stuff which is virtuous.

A thing which is possible is that many prenu resemble (in that $c$ facilitates increasing in doing stuff which is virtuous) VARIK.  That (the thing is possible) justifies that VARIK suggests resembling (in $c$) VARIK.

### The Proof of Describing Emotions
The proof of that (VARIK describes the emotions of VARIK), a.k.a. "$f$" is relevant to...

* that ($f$ facilitates that VARIK increases in stuff which is virtuous),
* that ($f$ is an event of being very honest/sincere),
* that (VARIK hopes that $f$ facilitates that prenu which are not VARIK increase in stuff which is virtuous),
* that ($f$ facilitates no thing which is immoral),
* that (for all things $t$, if $t$ facilitates stuff which is virtuous and facilitates no thing which is immoral, then $t$ is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK), and
* that (being very honest/sincere is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK).

The proof of that $f$ facilitates that VARIK increases in stuff which is virtuous is relevant to...

* that ($f$ facilitates that (VARIK discovers whether VARIK causes stuff which is immoral), a.k.a. "$n_1$"),
* that ($f$ facilitates that (VARIK remembers that increasing in stuff which is virtuous is possible), a.k.a. "$n_2$"),
* le su'u ko'a filri'a ko'o goi lo nu ko'e morji le du'u cumki fa lo nu zenba le ka ce'u jai vrude gi ga je
* that ($n_1$ and $n_2$ facilitate that VARIK increases in stuff which is virtuous),
* that (for all things $t$, if $t$ facilitates considering emotions, then $t$ facilitates increasing in stuff which is virtuous), and
* that (for all $f_1$, for all $f_2$, for all $f_3$, if $f_1$ facilitates $f_2$, and $f_2$ facilitates $f_3$, then $f_1$ facilitates $f_3$).

## The Request for All Prenu
For all prenu $p$, VARIK requests...

* that (for all things (which are intended by $p$) $i$, $p$ considers whether $i$ is virtuous),
* that (for all things (which are acted by $p$) $i$, $i$ considers the goal/justification/purpose of $i$), and
* that ($p$ remembers that (stuff which is virtuous is possible) and that change is possible).

The request applies to VARIK; VARIK is a prenu.

## Spiritual Pain or Whatever
VARIK experiences spiritual pain/sadness/(complaint emotion) about that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is a theist and believes that the god of $p$ is exceeded in stuff which is virtuous).

But the thing which is important is whether the prenu which believes attempts stuff which is virtuous.  A thing which is possible is doing stuff (whic his virtuous) _and_ believing in a god which is exceeded in doing stuff which is virtuous. 

A thing which is possible is that VARIK is flawed in experiencing (about the belief) spiritual pain/sadness/discomfort/(complaint emotion).  Additionally, a thing which is possible is that the cause of the spiritual pain/sadness/discomfort/(complaint emotion) is that VARIK empathises with prenu which believe in gods which are feared.  But VARIK is not certain.

## That (Stuff which is Virtuous is Possible)
The proof of that stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible is relevant to...

* that (a thing which causes stuff which rocks and is virtuous is that _many_ prenu attempt stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
* that (a thing which is possible is that _many_ prenu attempt stuff which rocks and is virtuous), and
* that (for all things $t_1$, for all things $t_2$, if $t_1$ is possible, and $t_1$ causes $t_2$, then $t_2$ is possible).
