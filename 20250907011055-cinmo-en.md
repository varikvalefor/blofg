The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250907) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some event of that VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK slightly experiences a headache),
* that (VARIK is not certain about the cause of the headache),
* that (VARIK is not extremely-extremely tired),
* that (VARIK does not extremely-extremely experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about being agender, and the justification is relevant to that (being agender facilitates assisting prenu which resemble (in being transgender) VARIK), that (being agender is inherent to VARIK and is not a flaw), and that (that (all prenu resemble all prenu) bores and anti-facilitates stuff which rocks)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is glad about being agender), which exceeds (in facilitating stuff which rocks and is virtuous) being sad (or whatever) about being agender)
* that (VARIK thanks prenu which non-xenophobially accept prenu),
* that (VARIK desires crying),
* that (VARIK somewhat desires (that VARIK draws)... but is not certain about the thing which should be drawn by VARIK),
* that (VARIK _slightly_ envies prenu which exceed (in creating photographs which rock) VARIK),
* that (VARIK understands that photographing many things facilitates increasing) (which facilitates decreasing in being envious),
* that (VARIK attempts that prenu remember (or whatever) that no thing which is inherent is a flaw),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about that (prenu state that (prenu are religious) but are not non-culturally religious), that (many prenu desire war), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK attempts (via communicating with prenu) that prenu discover or remember that (stuff which is virtuous and rocks is possible) and attempt stuff which rocks and is virtuous),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain and feels that VARIK is insufficient in attempting),
* that (VARIK welcomes accompanying (in publicly describing emotions which are experienced) VARIK and opines that publicly describing emotions facilitates increasing (in qualities which are virtuous) and decreasing in qualities which are immoral),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain and attempts to discover the stuff which can be done by VARIK and is an event of "improving" or facilitating that prenu increase (in qualities which are virtuous) or decrease in qualities which are immoral),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear or whatever about that (a thing which ius possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral, e.g., being angry at prenu) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous, e.g., empathising with all prenu)),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (VARIK increases (in all qualities which are virtuous, e.g., assisting all prenu which can be assisted by VARIK) and decreases in all qualities which are immoral), a.k.a. "$B$"), that (VARIK very attempts $B$), and
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being immoral and fucked) (which includes civil war) and is extreme in hoping (for stuff which is extreme in being virtuous and in rocking), i.e., in believing that (stuff which is extreme in being virtuous and in rocking is possible, but that (many prenu attempt) is necessary)).

## Being Slightly Envious
Many prenu (which photograph birds) $p$ exist such that some thing is contemporaneous with that (VARIK does not dislike $p$ but slightly envies (for creating photographs which are extremely good) $p$).

A part of the cause of envying is that VARIK desires that VARIK increases in creating photographs which are great.

But envying is not great/virtuous and is not inherent to VARIK.  Additionally, envying facilitates being angry (at prenu which exceed), which is immoral.

A thing which facilitates that VARIK decreases in envying is that VARIK thinks about...

* that (increasing is facilitated by creating many-many photographs),
* that (VARIK is not extremely-extreme in creating many-many photographs),
* that (being angry about things which are inherent facilitates nothing which is great, and being angry about things which are not inherent does not facilitate increasing),
* that (a flaw _of VARIK_ is VARIK is exceeded (by many prenu) in creating photographs which are great),
* that (the result creating photographs (which are great) and no photographs which suck is boring and anti-facilitates encouraging n00bs),
* that (the thing which is important is whether the photographs facilitate empathising and caring), and that (unimportant is whether the photographs are created by VARIK).

VARIK hopes that the thing facilitates that prenu which resemble VARIK decrease in envy.

## le ka ce'u djica curmi lo nu kansa
VARIK describes (for all prenu which desire attending/listening/observing) the emotions which are experienced by VARIK.

VARIK opines...

* that (publicly describing emotions facilitates that (VARIK discovers about stuff which sucks and is caused by VARIK), which facilitates increasing (in qualities which are virtuous) and decreasing in qualities which are immoral) and
* that (publicly describing emotions facilitates that prenu (which are not VARIK but attend to the writing of VARIK) increase in the property (of knowing that (feeling is not a flaw) and that stuff which is virtuous is possible) and whatnot).

For all prenu $p$, if a thing which is possible is that that ($p$ publicly describes the emotions which are experienced by $p$) facilitates that $p$ increases in qualities which are virtuous and decreases in qualities which are immoral, then VARIK suggests that $p$ publicly describes the emotions which are experienced by $p$.
