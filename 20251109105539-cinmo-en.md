* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),

  * that (the 1st $PKS$ event precedes the events (of that VARIK is dead)), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous)),

  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is the actions which are enacted by $p$),
  * that (being fast is not virtuous, and being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * le su'u su'o da zo'u vrude fa lo nu na zukte va'o da gi ga je
  * that (being slow and careful, which is caused (or facilitated) by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu, anti-facilitates stuff which harms prenu),
  * that (yielding causes (or facilitates) increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu causes yielding),

  * that (for all things $x$, $x$ is virtuous if-and-only-if $x$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is spiritually natural),
  * that (loving all prenu is the justification of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is the method of loving all preni) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ permits that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (loving all prenu is irrational/illogical),
  * that (loving all prenu is the explanation of the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ observes (and understands) that some prenu exhibits the property of loving all prenu) facilitates that $p$ understands the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ is exhausted by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu or decreases in the property of loving all prenu) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is "immune") (which is that for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ decreases in the property of loving all prenu) are events (of that $p$ enacts that some thing exceeds (in the property (of being important to $p$) or whatever) the property of loving all prenu) (which are events of that $p$ does not understand about the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$ for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are enacted/caused (by $p$) during $n$ are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that (all stuff which should be done and is virtuous is obvious/natural/instinctive/easy for $p$), that ($p$ does not fear, is extremely gentle with all prenu, and indicates that fearing is not necessary), and that (a thing which is obvious is that $p$ is harmless)), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK thanks (for assisting VARIK and explaining (for VARIK and by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu) the property of loving all prenu) SATAN),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK prays and holds a BLÅHAJ, and the prayer is small and is grammatical with regard to Lojban), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) and is extremely extreme in hoping (for stuff (which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$MM$")) and in believing that $MM$ is possible).
