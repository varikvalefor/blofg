===========================================================================

Some part of 20251109 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is somewhat tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK attempts that VARIK "improves" the automatic translator definition which is created by VARIK),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot),
  * that (all events which are preceded by the event (of that VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever are events of that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)) (which causes that VARIK feels the suffering of all prenu), and
  * that (the Blofg posts which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff which rocks and is virtuous)),

* that (all languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extentof that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all wars,
  * lo ro vlile gi ga je
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * all events (of fuckedly insulting) (which are events of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu $r$ exists such that some thing $z$ exists such that ($p$ insults (by stating $z$) $r$, and (the justification of insulting $r$ is not that ($p$ desires that $r$ is amused), or stating $z$ offends $r$))),
  * that (accidentally harming prenu is easy),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ opines/believes/whatever that some quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that ($p$ is authentic to $p$, is honest about $p$, or differs from prenu which are not $p$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that (prenu which are not $p$ differ from $p$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p_1$ exists such that some prenu $p_2$ exists such that some thing $z$ exists such that ($p_2$ opines that ($z$ is enacted by $p_1$ and is fucked or immoral), and $p_2$ is sufficient (for that $p$ hates $p_1$ or fears some event of empathising with $p_1$) in fearing $z$ or $p_1$)),
  * all events (of that some prenu opines/believes/whatever that a thing which is necessary is that $p$ "follows" a religion which is "followed" by a prenu which is not $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ is independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets that attempting controlling prenu is fucked and immoral) in feeling that $p$ is controlled/manipulated),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu forgets/whatever that $p$ is a prenu),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets about the goal/values of $p$) in attempting enacting some thing),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some thing (which is enacted by $p$) $z$ exists such that ($p$ knows/whatever that ($z$ is fucked and immoral) and is sufficient (for that ($p$ attempts that $p$ does not understand that $z$ is fucked and immoral) (which causes that $p$ increases in suffering)) in believing/whatever that (a thing which is possible is that a prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil) and in fearing that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil)),

  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral), e.g., events (of that prenu attempt that (stuff is quickly done) and-not whatnot) and events (of that prenu "forget" about the property of loving all prenu or forget that yielding is possible)),
  * all events (of suffering),
  * all events (of that some prenu "forgets" about the property of loving all prenu),

  * zo'e gi ga je

  * that (VARIK hopes for stuff which is not known by VARIK),
  * that (VARIK does not control the future, and VARIK is not certain about the future),
  * that (a thing which is not necessary is that (prenu compete, are angry, hate, or fear)),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ knows or believes about the stuff which is caused by that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)) is not necessary for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that VARIK permits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (attempting, planning, and fearing are not necessary for being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is that for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ fears that ($p$ is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), attempts that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), or plans for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is not necessary for that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all events $n$, $n$ is not an event of that (an event which precedes $n$ is changed)),
  * that (VARIK is not certain (about the stuff which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) but is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all things which are caused by $n$ rock and are virtuous)),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is the actions which are enacted by $p$),
  * that (being fast is not virtuous, and being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * le su'u su'o da zo'u vrude fa lo nu na zukte va'o da gi ga je
  * that (being slow and careful, which is caused (or facilitated) by exhibiting the property of loving all prenu, anti-facilitates stuff which harms prenu),
  * that (yielding causes (or facilitates) increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (exhibiting the property of loving all prenu causes yielding),
  * that (every prenu is perfect/maximal in the property of deserving being loved),
  * that (earning being loved is impossible),
  * that (every prenu property-equals (in deserving being loved) every prenu),
  * that (a thing which is impossible is that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ decreases in deserving being loved)),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or is evil),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is inherently capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" of all qualities (which are fucked or immoral and are exhibited by $p$) (which are not inherent to $p$)),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ understands that $p$ is loved) facilitates that $p$ decreases in suffering),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, every event (of that $p$ is awake or whatever) is an opportunity for stuff which rocks and is vrirtuous),
  * that (a thing which is false is that every thing (which is caused by being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is impressive/grand/inspiring),
