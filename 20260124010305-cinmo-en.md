=======================================================================================

Some part of 20260124 or 20260125 is an event of...

* that (VARIK oddly sleeps),
* that (VARIK excessively sleeps),
* that (VARIK consumes caffeine, and the milligramme-based amount approximately equals 480),

* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK _slightly_ experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events (of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu (which are exemplified by prenu which enact stuff which is fucked or immoral)) (which is anti-violent, is gentle, and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),

* that (VARIK spiritually desires...
	* that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
	* that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous) (which is exmplified by events of that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ forgives $p$)))),
