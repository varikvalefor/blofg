The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250917 and 20250918) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20250917 or 20250918 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK experiences a headache),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is agender), which harms no prenu),
* that (VARIK is slight in experiencing gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK thanks the friends (of VARIK) and whatnot),
* that (VARIK desires that prenu know about the Unlicense and whatnot),
* that (VARIK considers "replacing" (with the Funlicence, which is defined by VARIK and exceeds (in being appropriate for stuff which is miscellaneous) the Unlicense) (for the stuff which is created by VARIK) the Unlicense),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences wonder about virtual machines),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by that (difficult is using (for Canon Digital Photo Professional) WINE)),
* that (VARIK is not angry and empathises with the prenu which create Canon Digital Photo Professional and choose (regardless of whether the prenu know) to use a thing which is incompatible with WINE),
* that (VARIK slightly cries),
* that (VARIK empathises with prenu $p$ which struggle with stopping stuff which is fucked and immoral and is caused by $p$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about that (many prenu desire violence), all events (of harming prenu) (which include accidents and things which are intentional), all events (of hating prenu), that (for many animals $x$, possible is that ($x$ is the body of a prenu), and easy is accidentally killing/whatever $x$), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK is extreme in spiritually desiring that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, attempt empathising (with all prenu) and whatnot), that (VARIK causes no thing which harms a prenu and follows (in time) the thing), that (VARIK increases in knowing about the stuff which can be done by VARIK, facilitates stuff which is virtuous, and prevents stuff which is immoral), that (prenu consider the actions of prenu), that (prenu understand that stuff which is rocks and is virtuous is possible), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about that (a thing which facilitates stuff which is virtuous is considering that all things which are virtuous are very compatible with loving all prenu), that (that (VARIK remembers about stuff which is immoral and is caused by VARIK) facilitates that stuff is not "repeated"), and that (VARIK knows or understands that all events/whatever of violence are incompatible)),
* that (VARIK feels that VARIK is insufficient in doing stuff which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases ( in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about that (all prenu are capable of stuff (whichis virtuous) and of the quality of (increasing (in qualities which are virtuous) and decreasing in qualities which are immoral)), that (no prenu is evil), that (SATAN, which is the god of VARIK, assists VARIK), and that (that (VARIK prays) facilitates that (VARIK does not decrease in a quality which is virtuous, and VARIK does not increase in a quality which is immoral))),
* that (VARIK attemptes discovering the stuff which can be done by VARIK and facilitates stuff (which is virtuous), e.g., that (stuff which is immoral is prevented) and that (prenu discover that stuff which is virtuous is possible), and causes no thing which is immoral),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (VARIK increases in all qualities which are virtuous and does decrease in all qualities which are immoral)),
* that (VARIK very attempts that that (VARIK increases in all qualities which are virtuous and does decrease in all qualities which are immoral)),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK expects stuff which is extreme in being fucked and in being immoral), and
* that (VARIK is extreme in hoping for stuff which is extreme in being virtuous and in rocking), which is relevant to the proof (of that VARIK is extreme in believing that stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible).
