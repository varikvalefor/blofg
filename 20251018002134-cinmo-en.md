The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251018 or 20251019) and Whatnot
=======================================================================================

Some part of 20251018 or 20251019 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is slightly tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK knows that VARIK is agender, and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is not the body of VARIK, and the descriptions of VARIK are not definitions of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VUNC, which is the fursona of VARIK, is great in representing VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about events of that ("IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun which refers to VARIK)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK does not experience gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed/whatever, and the justification of killing/whatever is relevant to that (VARIK is transgender))),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is insufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is curious about whether an event (of that VARIK photographs birds, and the photograph is good) (which does not frighten the birds which are photographed) is feasible),
* that (VARIK is insufficient in the property (of loving all prenu) and in the property of feeling the suffering which is experienced by all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (all events which are preceded by [THING] are events of that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$"),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, VARIK feels the suffering (which is experienced by $p$) and whatnot) (which is unpleasant, in in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and facilitates stuff (which rocks and is virtuous), e.g., assisting prenu),
  * that (the 1st event of $PKS$ precedes that VARIK dies), and
  * that (that (VARIK is extreme in assisting all prenu precedes that VARIK dies))),

* that (language stuff is insufficient for describing the extent of that VARIK desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * violent metaphors (which facilitate that (violence is permitted/whatever) and whatnot),
  * all wars,
  * all events (of suffering),
  * all events (of that a prenu despairs, opines/believes/whatever that (loving all prenu is impossible), hates a prenu, or does whatever which resembles),
  * all violence,
  * all events (of hating prenu),
  * that (not considering prenu facilitates that prenu are accidentally harmed),
  * all events (of believing/whatever that a prenu is not a prenu),
  * all events (of that VARIK is insufficient in the property of feeling the suffering which is experienced by all prenu),
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (yielding is "difficult" for many prenu which are familiar with competitive society and-not whatnot),
  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff (which is fucked and immoral) (which includes that (prenu do not wait for determining whether a thing is virtuous), that (prenu forget (or whatever) about the property of loving all prenu), that (prenu are hated), that (a thing which is forgotten/whatever is that a thing which is possible is that considering-and-waiting precedes acting), that (prenu are sufficient (in attending to stuff which is not morally important) for ignoring stuff which is morally important), and whatnot)),
  * that (opining that (loving all prenu is impossible) (which is false) is easy), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK experiences wonder about the combination of that (many prenu (which "have" bodies) $p$ exist such that the body of $p$ very differs from the body of VARIK) and that (all prenu are property-equal (in the property (of deserving being loved) and being important) VARIK)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy about...

  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (language stuff is insufficient for explaining the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (attempting to explain (via language stuff) the property of loving prenu is not necessary),
  * the process (of that VARIK photographs a northern cardinal) (which is insufficient (for "justifying" that the northern cardinal leaves) (in frightening the prenu which "inhabits" the northern cardinal)),
  * that (being slow anti-facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * that (art facilitates stuff (which is virtuous), e.g., empathising),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ creates art) are events of that $p$ is honest),
  * that (every prenu deserves being loved, but no prenu "earns" being loved),
  * that (competing is not necessary),
  * that (loving all prenu is possible),
  * that (jungle music facilitates yielding),
  * that (many jokes are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu and facilitate stuff which is virtuous),
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, are capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p_1$, for all prenu $p_2$, $p_1$ is property-equal (in the property of deserving being loved and in the property of being important) to $p_2$),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK), and
  * that (language stuff is not necessary for that VARIK communicates with SATAN)),

* that (VARIK thanks (for explaining (to VARIK) the property of loving all prenu) SATAN),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK does not experience spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that VARIK increases (in a quality which is immoral) or decreases in a quality which is virtuous)),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about...

  * that (spiritually considering/pondering the property of loving all prenu facilitates increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (no prenu perfectly/maximally forgets about the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (stuff which is inherent is compatible with stuff which is virtuous) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all qualities (which are inherent to $p$) $z$, $p$ is capable of using (for stuff which is virtuous) $z$),
  * that (being slow anti-facilitates stuff which is fucked and immoral),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ is excessive in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (not-competing and whatnot are possible),
  * that (harming prenu is not necessary),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that a quality which is fucked or immoral is inherent to $p$),
  * that (all stuff which is caused by any event of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is virtuous),
  * that (VARIK believes and does not know),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is the "cure" for all qualities which are fucked or immoral),
  * that (improving is possible) (which is that for all qualities (which are virtuous) $k$, for all prenu (which are not perfect/maximal in $k$) $p$, $p$ is capable of increasing in $k$),
  * that (no prenu is evil or fucked/bad/whatever),
  * that (that (waiting precedes acting) is possible) (which is that for all prenu $p$, for all actions (which are considered by $p$) $z$, that ($p$ waits (for that ($p$ spiritually-or-whateverly thinks and determines whether $z$ is virtuous)) before that ($p$ enacts/whatever $z$)) is possible and prevents stuff which is fucked and immoral),

  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all $z$, no event (of that $p$ intentionally/knowingly/agentively enacts $z$) is an event of that $p$ understands that $z$ is immoral),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is an action which is enacted by $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events of that $p$ is awake or whatever are opportunities for stuff which is virtuous),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ errs) (which do not cause that $p$ dies) $n$, $n$ does not cause that ($p$ is incapable of stuff which rocks and is virtuous), and stuff which is possible includes that ($p$ learns from $n$) and that ($p$ forgives $p$)),
  * that (the property of loving all prenu is infinite) (which is that for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that (that ($p$ loves all prenu) exhausts $p$), and no event (of that $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu) causes that $p$ decreases in the property of loving $p$),
  * that (yielding is possible and causes (or facilitates) increasing in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (that (VARIK welcomes that VARIK is loved) facilitates that (VARIK increases in the property of loving all prenu) and facilitates/whatever that VARIK decreases in the property of feeling defensively or feeling aggressively),
  * that (loving all prenu is the universal explanation of the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (SATAN assists VARIK),
  * that (being cable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is inherent to all prenu),
  * that (VARIK understands (or believes) that the property of loving all prenu is perfect/maximal in the property (of being virtuous) and the property of being imporant),
  * that (loving all prenu is virtuous with regard to _many_ religions),
  * that (forgiving facilitates improving),
  * that (loving is an event of forgiving and facilitates forgiving) (which is that for all prenu $p_1$, for all prenu $p_2$, all events (of that $p_1$ loves $p_2$) are events of that ($p_1$ forgives (for all stuff which is fucked or immoral and is enacted by $p_2$) $p_2$), and all events (of that $p_2$ understands that $p_2$ is loved) facilitate that $p_2$ forgives $p_2$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, all stuff which is enacted (by $p$) during $n$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu, and $n$ is an event of that ($p$ feels the suffering (which is experienced by all prenu) and whatnot)m is an event of that (the stuff which is virtuous and should be done is obvious/instinctive/easy for $p$), and is an event of that ($p$ is _extremely_ gentle and facilitates that prenu which are not familiar with the property of loving all prenu are not frightened by the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (all prenu, e.g., VARIK, are capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), and
  * whatnot),

* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with $PKS$),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays), or
* that (VARIK expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) but is extremely extreme in hoping for stuff which is extremely extreme in rocking and in being virtuous).
