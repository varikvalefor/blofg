# The Blog
VARIK likes that `blofg`, which is a blog or whatever, facilitates that (VARIK quickly writes things which are large) and that VARIK writes and does not use the Internet.  Liking is a part of the justification of that VARIK increases in using `blofg`.

But a thing which continues is that VARIK uses (for things which are small) Mastodon.  Possible is that a cluster (of Mastodon posts) $t$ exists such that $t$ should "become" a `blofg` post.
