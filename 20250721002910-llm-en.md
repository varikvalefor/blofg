That (Neural Networks are Inappropriate for Lojban)
===================================================

VARIK is amused (but not surprised) by that (the neural networks are fuckedly incompatible with translating to English and from Lojban).

A part of the cause of discovering that the things are incompatible is that VARIK attempts to use (for translating to English and from Lojban) a neural network.  False is that VARIK very enjoys translating.

 A neural network $n$ exists such that $n$ some translations which are created by $n$ contain the wrong words, are not grammatical, or semantically differ from the translation source.

But VARIK assumes that that (Lojban is of a parsing expression grammar) and whatnot facilitate that Lojban is "difficult" for neural networks.

VARIK very attempts that VARIK is patient with prenu.  But VARIK does not perfectly attempt that VARIK is patient with computer stuff.  VARIK is willing to assist Lojban n00bs which use (for contacting VARIK) I2P or whatever.  Assisting Lojban n00bs is not an event of explaining for a thing which is incapable of understanding.

## The Proof of Attempting

### Theorem
VARIK attempts using (for translating to English and from Lojban) neural networks.

### Proof
For all $p$, for all $s$, if (VARIK desires $s$, and $p$ is easy for VARIK, and that (VARIK non-automatically-assistedly causes $s$) somewhat bores VARIK, and VARIK opines that (possible is that $p$ facilitates $s$), and VARIK is curious about whether $p$ is appropriate for $s$), then VARIK attempts using (for $s$) $p$.

VARIK desires translating to English and from Lojban.

Neural networks are easy for VARIK.

VARIK opines that possible is that neural networks facilitate translating to English and from Lojban.

VARIK is curious about whether neural networks are appropriate for translating to English and from Lojban.

Therefore, VARIK attempts using (for translating to English and from Lojban) neural networks.  Q.E.D.

## Flaws
A neural network $n$ and a Lojban utterance $l$ exist such that a flaw of the Lojban translation (of $l$) (which is created by $n$) $e$ is...

* that ($e$ contains a word $v_1$ such that some word should "replace" (in $e$) $v_1$),
* that ($e$ is not grammatical),
* that ($e$ is extreme in semantically differing from $l$), i.e., that ($e$ pertains to some thing $x$ such that $l$ does not pertain to $x$), or
* that (the meaning of $e$ is the opposite of the meaning of $l$), which is fuckedly common.

## Fucked Examples
* Google Gemini, a.k.a. "$L_1$", repeatedly outputs stuff which indicates that the gloss of "kirsku" is "scream".  But the gloss of "kirsku" is "thank".
* $L_1$ outputs stuff which indicates that the gloss of "tolmapti" resembles "monstrously appropriate" or something.  But the definition of "tolmapti" is "$m_1$ is incompatible with $m_2$ in aspect $m_3$".
