The Emotions (which are Experienced (During 20250830) by VARIK) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the translation source of the current sentence) is contemporaneous with...

* that (VARIK is glad about being agender),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK welcomes that (prenu accompany (in being honest about identity and whatnot) VARIK), which facilitates stuff which is virtuous, e.g., not hating),
* that (_somewhat_ difficult for VARIK is describing the emotions which are experienced by VARIK),
* that (VARIK attempts that (VARIK translates (to English and from Lojban) "PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM"), which implies (or whatever) discovering the stuff which is important such that the stuff is appropriate for being a terbri of the translation word),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (VARIK sends (to a chatroom (which is moderated by a prenu which attempts forbidding that VARIK sends questions regarding rules) $r$) a message which contains a photograph (which depicts a bee) and a statement which indicates that (photographing the bee is an accident)... and is banned from $r$), a.k.a. "$B$"),
* that (VARIK is _somewhat_ annoyed by $B$),
* that (VARIK very thanks the prenu which are patient with that (prenu, e.g., VARIK, are angry) and acknowledges that being patient is difficult),
* that (VARIK hopes and attempts that VARIK increases in being competent with the focusing system of the camera which is used by VARIK),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (VARIK attempts (that VARIK finds and photographs birds)... but finds and photographs no birds but many insects)),
* that (VARIK somewhat struggles with determining photographs which are "on" the SD card (of the camera which is used by VARIK) and should be "deleted"),
* that (VARIK experiences mild wonder about that (the camera which is used by VARIK automatically focuses on the eyes of birds and whatnot)),
* that (VARIK is surprised by accidentally photographing (during the flight of the bee) a bee),
* that ("LK (MARCUS INTALEX & ST FILES Remix)" of DJ MARKY is very beautiful to VARIK, and VARIK acknowledges that that (the thing is very beautiful to VARIK) is familiar to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by that (VARIK responds with sarcasm), which is an event of non-honesty),
* that (VARIK hopes and attempts that VARIK discovers stuff which facilitates that prenu remember or discover that (stuff which rocks and is virtuous is possible) and that failing is not the end of possibility),
* that (VARIK very experiences spiritual pain about that (prenu state that some prenu are not prenu)),
* that (VARIK requests that SATAN assists with that (VARIK increases (in all qualities which are virtuous, which include the property (of mistreating no prenu), the property (of asssisting (or whatever {VERB}) (with increasing in qualities which are virtuous) all prenu), and the property (of being honest with all prenu)) and decreases in all properties which are immoral, e.g., the property (of responding sarcastically), the property (of being angry at prenu), and the property (of being fast... but not very attempting to discover whether the thing is virtuous)), a.k.a. "$A$"),
* that (VARIK very attempts $A$),
* that (VARIK welcomes accompanying in attempting to increase in all qualities (which are virtuous) and decrease in all properties which are immoral), and
* that (VARIK very expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and in being immoral)... but _extremely_ hopes for stuff which is extreme in being virtuous and in rocking).

## Banning VARIK
A sequence of events which happens is...

* that (VARIK sends (via a chatroom, a.k.a. "$k$") a screenshot regarding a blofg post which is created by VARIK),
* that (a prenu, a.k.a. "$p_1$", asks about whether VARIK requests (from SATAN) assisting with stuff which is virtuous),
* that (a prenu which is not $p_1$ states that VARIK is a Theistic Satanist),
* that ($p_1$ states that $p_1$ is slightly confused),
* that (VARIK states that VARIK welcomes sending questions),
* that ($p_1$ states that (the thing is incompatible with the rules of $p_1$) and that $p_1$ does not desire sending (to VARIK) a direct message),
* that (VARIK sends a photograph (which depicts a bee) and states that photographing the bee is an accident), and
* that VARIK is banned from $k$.

## The Photograph which Depicts the Bee
VARIK attempts to photograph a flower (which is white), a.k.a. "$x$".

The result of attempting photographing $x$ is a photograph which depicts $x$... and the event of that (a bee, a.k.a. "$b$", flies to $x$ or something).

VARIK is surprised by that (the thing depicts $b$, and VARIK does not attempt to photograph $b$, and many events (of photographing bees) which are attempted by VARIK are difficult for VARIK).

But that (the photograph is created) is contemporaneous with that (the bee is not perfectly focused on the sensor of the camera which is used by VARIK).

## Autofocus
The Canon EOS R7, which is used by VARIK, automatically "attempts" to focus (onto the sensor of the R7) the eyes of birds and whatnot.

VARIK experiences wonder about that (frequent is that the R7 succeeds in focusing on the eyes of birds and whatnot).

But a thing which amuses VARIK is that $\{x | \textrm{R7 ATTEMPTS FOCUSING ON}\ x\}$ includes...

* images (which depict the eyes of birds) and
* things (which resemble eyes but are not eyes), which include some screws.

VARIK is somewhat curious about the algorithm for determining whether things are eyes.

## LK
That (VARIK writes/expresses the thing) is contemporaneous with that (VARIK is extreme in "finding" that "LK (MARCUS INTALEX & ST FILES Remix)", which is a remix of "LK", which is created by DJ MARKY, is beautiful).

But that (the remix is beautiful to VARIK) is very familiar to VARIK.  Being familiar precedes writing the previous sentence.

A thing which continues is that VARIK very suggests that prenu which like jungle or drum-and-bass music listen to the remix.  The remix is drum-and-bass music, and VARIK very prefers (over drum-and-bass music) jungle music, but VARIK very likes the remix.
