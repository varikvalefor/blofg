The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20251221) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

Some part of 20251221 is an event of...

* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (VARIK understands that VARIK is agender), and that being agender is inherent to VARIK),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is transgender) (which is not inherent to VARIK but is inherent to the combination of VARIK and the body of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) and events (of that VARIK experiences discomfort about that prenu assume (about VARIK) stuff which is incorrect) indicate that VARIK is VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is glad about event of that "IT" or whatever is used as a pronoun of VARIK),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed or whatever, and the justification is relevant to that VARIK is transgender, is weird, and is extreme)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK intends that (VARIK protects and assists all prenu) (which is anti-violent and is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is not sufficient (for that VARIK cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually desires...

  * that (every event which is preceded by the event of that VARIK writes the current sentence is an event of that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$PKS$") and
  * that (the Blofg entries which are created by VARIK facilitate stuff (which rocks and is virtuous))),

* that (the languages which are used by VARIK are insufficient for communicating the extent of that VARIK spiritually desires $PKS$),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about...

  * all events (of war),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences affluenza),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu is angry at $p$ or hates $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu is mistreated),
  * all events (of violence),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ fears that ($p$ is independent in spiritually/whatever-ly considering stuff) or that (some prenu which is not $p$ "follows" a religion which is not "followed" by $p$) or opines/whatever that (for all prenu $r$, if $r$ is religious, then $r$ attempts "religiously" controlling/manipulating prenu which are not $r$)) in that prenu attempt/whatever to "religiously" control/manipulate $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts that evidence indicates that the "religion" of $p$ is correct) in fearing that $p$ believes and does not know),

  * the idea (of hell),
  * all events (of that some prenu experiences "religious" trauma),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu, e.g., $p$, opines that (

    * $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil or is capable of being fucked/bad/whatever or evil, or
    * $p$ is incapable of doing art, or
    * $p$ does not deserve being loved, or
    * a thing which is possible is that ($p$ enacts some thing which causes that $p$ earns being loved),
    * $p$ is incapable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu, or
    * being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu is difficult of $p$, or
    * $p$ is not a prenu) (which is false)),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that some prenu, e.g., $p$, attempts/whatever that $p$ does not exhibit a quality (which is inherent to $p$) (which is exemplified by the gender identity of $p$)),

  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ attempts/whatever that (prenu which are not $p$ seem to be insufficient, and $p$ seems to be sufficient)) in fearing that $p$ is insufficient) (which are events of suffering),
  * events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ does not know),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ attempts that ($p$ resembles prenu which are not $p$) and is not authentic to $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is sufficient (for that $p$ forgets that ($p$ is capable of stuff which rocks and is virtuous)... or that $p$ is a prenu) in experiencing guilt),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ is authentic to $p$, is honest about $p$, or exhibits qualities which are inherent to $p$),
  * all events (of that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ fears that $p$ understands about the nature/identity/self/whatever of $p$),
  * all events (of that some thing $z$ exists such that some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ knows that ($p$ enacts $z$) and that ($z$ is fucked or immoral) and is sufficient (for that ($p$ attempts that prenu, e.g., $p$, do not understand that ($z$ is fucked or immoral) or that $p$ enacts $z$)... or that $p$ does not stop enacting stuff which resembles $z$) in fearing that ($p$ is punished for $z$) or the combination (of that ($p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil, and the proof is relevant to that $p$ enacts some thing which is fucked or immoral) (which is impossible) and that ($p$ understands that ($p$ enacts a thing which is fucked or immoral), and the result is that $p$ opines/whatever that $p$ is fucked/bad/whatever or evil))) (which cause (or facilitate) that (prenu increase in suffering) and that prenu continue enacting stuff which is fucked or immoral),

  * that (competitive society facilitates stuff (which is fucked or immoral) (which is exemplified by events of that (some prenu $p$ exists such that $p$ is-angry-at (or hates) some prenu, attempts that ($p$ is not $p$), or  forgets anout the nature/identity/self/whatever of $p$))), and
  * all events (of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which are forgiven by VARIK), and
  * whatnot),

  * that (VARIK is not certain about the future, and VARIK does not control the future),
  * all events (of that VARIK is sufficient (for that VARIK non-slightly cries) in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (VARIK is not certain about the stuff which is caused by events of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu, but VARIK is certain about that (for all prenu $p$, for all events (of that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $n$, for all things (which are caused/effected by $n$) $r$, $r$ rocks and is virtuous, and the proof is relevant to that $r$ is in accordance with the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) is inevitable (under that VARIK permits that VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu)),
  * that (every event (of that VARIK whatever-ly errs) is an event of that VARIK is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (being fast is not virtuous, and being active/busy is not virtuous),
  * that (a situation $s$ exists such that not acting in $s$ is virtuous),
  * that (evidence is not necessary for believing),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is not necessary for that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is hereinafter denoted by "$n$") is that ($p$ attempts $n$, plans for $n$, fears that ($n$ does not happen), or believes/is-certain/knows about the stuff which is caused/effected by $n$)),
  * that (for all events $n$, $n$ is an event of that no event which precedes $n$ is changed),
  * that (no prenu $p$ exists such that some thing $z$ exists such that ($p$ enacts $z$, and that ($p$ enacts $z$) is contemporaneous with that $p$ understands that $z$ is immoral)),
  * that (no prenu is fucked/bad/whatever or evil or is capable of being fucked/bad/whatever or evil),
  * that (for all elements (of the set of the property (of being important), the property (of deserving being loved), and the property of being innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $x$, every prenu is perfect/maximal in $x$, and every prenu, e.g., VARIK, property-equals (in $x$) every prenu, e.g., SATAN, and (for all prenu $p$, a thing which is impossible is that $p$ decreases in $x$)),
  * that (being is sufficient),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, no quality which is inherent to $p$ is fucked or immoral, and $p$ is innately capable of being perfect/maximal in the property (of loving all prenu) and all qualities which are inherent to $p$, and all qualities which are inherent to $p$ are compatible with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, all events (of that $p$ is authentic to $p$) are in accordance with the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for every prenu (which is not perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) $p$, that ($p$ yields and understandingly permits that ($p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu) (which is not pleasant for $p$)) causes that $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ exhibits the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ loves $p$),
  * that (for all prenu $p$, if $p$ is perfect/maximal in understanding about the property of loving all prenu, then $p$ is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
