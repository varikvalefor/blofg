# Anger
Many things $t$ exist such that (VARIK is angry with/at $t$, and VARIK should-not (per VARIK) be angry with/at $t$).  But that (VARIK admits that (being angry is harmful) and discovers the cause of anger) facilitates that VARIK decreases in being angry.

Additionally, fucked is that (some $t$ exists such that $t$ is angry and denies that $t$ is angry), which facilitates stuff which is fucked.  Knowing that a thing is angry facilitates preventing the terrible.

Being angry is easy and does-not very-facilitate assisting or virtuous increasing.

VARIK admits that many prenu $p$ exist such that (VARIK mistreats $p$ because VARIK is angry with/at $p$).  VARIK does not desire forgiving VARIK.  VARIK hopes that VARIK increases in assisting and in causing the virtuous.
