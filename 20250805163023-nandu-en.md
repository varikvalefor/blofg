# Stuff which is Difficult
For an event $t$, if thinking about $t$ is difficult because $t$ is painfully immoral, then many things $x$ exist such that the importance/virtuousness of stopping $t$ exceeds the importance/virtuousness of $x$.  But for all immoral things $t$, a thing which is virtuous is that a prenu stops $t$ and does not do any thing which is immoral.

The stuff is difficult.  But rocking is difficult.  Stuff which is virtuous is difficult.
