# The Event of Sending the Transgender Image
"$T$" denotes a Discord server which is specific.  VARIK does not desire that VARIK specifies the name of $T$.

A prenu claims that $T$ is Christian.

VARIK sends (via $T$) "SHININGLIKECRYSTALTIARAS", which depicts the transgender flag and whatnot.  Additionally, VARIK states that VARIK welcomes criticism.

The operator of $T$ "removes" the "SHININGLIKECRYSTALTIARAS" message and states that "transgenderism" is forbidden.

"Removing" and forbidding justifies that (VARIK stops using $T$).

VARIK is not angry.  But VARIK is somewhat saddened.  VARIK assumes that $T$ is Christian.  But the thing indicates hating.

Being transgender is not a flaw.
That (a prenu $p$ states that $p$ is transgender) is not a flaw.
That (a prenu $p$ is not ashamed of that $p$ is transgender) is not a flaw.
Forgetting is easy.
