The Emotions (which are Experienced (by VARIK) during 20250927) and Whatnot)
============================================================================

Some part of 20250927 is an event of...

* that (VARIK slightly experiences a headache),
* that (VARIK is slightly tired),
* that (VARIK is extreme in being glad about that (VARIK is agender), that (being agender is inherent to VARIK), and that (VARIK knows that VARIK is agender)),

* that (VARIK is glad about being transgender),
* that (VARIK is (glad-about)/(amused-by) that (the fursona of VARIK resembles the agender flag)),
* that (VARIK slightly experiences gender dysphoria),
* that (VARIK struggles with the PeerTube server which is owned by VARIK),
* that (VARIK expects that (VARIK is killed, and that (VARIK is transgender) and whatnot are parts of the justification of killing VARIK)),
* that (VARIK does not fear that VARIK dies),
* that (VARIK is serious),
* that (VARIK feels that VARIK is fuckedly excessive in stuff which is immoral),
* that (VARIK feels that VARIK is fuckedly insufficient in stuff which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK desires that VARIK cries),
* that (VARIK is stressed about stuff which is fucked and immoral),
* that (VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is stressed about stuff which is fucked and immoral)),
* that (VARIK intends to protect and assist all prenu),
* that (no prenu $p$ exists such that VARIK is extremely angry at $p$),
* that (VARIK is not certain about whether VARIK is angry at a prenu),
* that (VARIK is insufficient in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK intends to be perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu),
* that (VARIK spiritually hopes for that (VARIK is perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), that (all prenu understand the property of loving all prenu and understand that (for all prenu $p$, $p$ is inherently capable of stuff which is virtuous) and that (fearing very facilitates hating, which very facilitates violence, which very facilitates fearing)), that (VARIK succeeds in protecting and assisting all prenu), that (for all prenu $p$, for all actions $z$, if $p$ considers enacting $z$, then $p$ waits (before enacting $z$) for that ($p$ determines whether $z$ is virtuous)), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual pain about all events (of that some prenu $p_1$ exists such that some prenu $p_2$ exists such that $p_1$ hates $p_2$), all events (of hating prenu, e.g., prenu which hate), that (many things $t$ exist such that a thing which is easy is that (a prenu $p$ attempts that ($t$ is done quickly) such that $p$ does not consder whether $t$ is virtuous)), that (VARIK is excessive in qualities (which are fucked or are immoral), e.g., being annoyed), that (excessive brain-thinking anti-facilitates exhibiting the property of loving all prenu), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual joy),
* that (VARIK is slight in experiencing spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that (VARIK decreases (in a quality which is virtuous) or increases in a quality which is immoral), a.k.a. "$D$)),
* that (VARIK experiences spiritual fear/whatever about that (a thing which is possible is that (VARIK decreases (in a quality which is virtuous) or increases in a quality which is immoral), a.k.a. "$D$)),
* that (VARIK attempts to prevent $D$),
* that (VARIK is extreme in experiencing spiritual hope about that (many things which are unlikely are possible), that (for all prenu $p$, that ($p$ loves all prenu) causes that (stuff which is virtuous is natural/instictive/intuitive/easy for $p$)), that (considering the property of loving all prenu facilitates stuff (which is virtuous), i.e., stuff which rocks in being compatible with the property of loving all prenu), that (no prenu $p$ exists such that a property (which is immoral) $k$ exists such that $k$ is inherent to $p$), that (all prenu are inherently capable of being perfect/maximal in the property of loving all prenu), and whatnot),
* that (VARIK non-linguistically prays),
* that (VARIK requests (via the part of the current sentence) that SATAN assists with that (VARIK increases (in all qualities (which are virtuous), e.g., the property of loving all prenu) and decreases in all qualities (which are immoral), e.g., the property of being angry at prenu)), or
* that (VARIK very expects stuff (which is extreme in being fucked and immoral) but is very extreme in hoping for stuff which is very extreme in being virtuous and in rocking).

## Experiencing a Headache
20250927 is the date of that (VARIK experiences a headache and is tired).

The night of 20250927 exceeds (in being a date of that (VARIK experiences a headache and is tired)) the morning of 20250927.

## Being Agender
VARIK is agender.

Many things are events (of that VARIK experiences gender dysphoria).  That (VARIK experiences gender dysphoria) is unpleasant for VARIK.

But VARIK is glad about that (VARIK is agender) and that (being agender is inherent to VARIK).  An event of that (VARIK is not agender) is an event of that (VARIK is not VARIK).
