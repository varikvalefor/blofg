The Emotions (which are Experienced (during 20250809) by VARIK) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever is contemporaneous with that...

* to (VARIK dislikes that PRONOUNS.PAGE. does not support stating that VARIK desires using (for referring to VARIK) variables which are explicitly assigned),
* that (VARIK hopes that VARIK becomes vegan, which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK, which is a mathematician, is somewhat annoyed by that (prenu assume that VARIK is a computer programmer)),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by computer crashes and whatnot),
* that (VARIK requests that (attempting to "fix" or recycle) precedes discarding),
* that (VARIK intends to "improve" "cukta", which is a book such that intended is that "cukta" facilitates learning about Lojban),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (obvious is that 1 is the Enneagram type of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK endures a headache),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria... but likes that "somewhat" and-not "extremely" applies),
* that (VARIK is mildly angry),
* that (VARIK struggles to describe the emotions which are experienced by VARIK),
* that (VARIK believes that some thing $t$ esxists such that for all prenu $p$, if $p$ understands $t$, then explaining $p$ is impossible (or difficult) for $p$),
* that (VAIRK requests that SATAN assists with that VARIK increases (in doing stuff (which is virtuous), i.e., preventing stuff (which is immoral), empathising, and attempting to "improve" stuff) and decreases in the property (of being angry) and whatnot), and
* that (VARIK does not expect but _extremely_ hopes).

## Veganism
Veganism is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.  The proof is easy.

But VARIK is not a vegan.  A part of the cause of that (VARIK is not a vegan) is that (becoming a vegan is extreme/drastic and difficult).  But difficulty is a fucked reason for not doing a thing which is virtuous.

VARIK is extreme in attempting to not kill ants and whatnot.  But the actions of VARIK "justify" killing chickens and whatnot.  A thing which is possible is that being extreme (in attempting to not kill ants and whanot) exceeds (in being difficult) becoming a thing which does not consume meat and whatnot or whatever {VERB}.

VARIK desires that VARIK becomes a vegan.

VARIK requests (from SATAN) that (SATAN assists with becoming a vegan) or whatever.

### Theorem 1
Veganism is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.

#### Proof

Veganism faciliates (not killing prenu) and no thing which is immoral.

Not killing prenu is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.

For all $t$, if $t$ facilitates stuff which is virtuous and no thing which is immoral, then $t$ is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.

Therefore, veganism is virtuous with regard to the religion of VARIK.

## Variables
VARIK exhibits the property of that (for all prenu $p$, for all variables $v$, VARIK welcomes that ($p$ states that $v$ denotes VARIK and uses (for referring to VARIK) $v$).  An example of variable pronoun use is "VARIK, a.k.a. '$z$', is $z$".

A sequence of events which happen is...

* that (VARIK begins creating a PRONOUNS.PAGE. description of VARIK),
* that (VARIK attempts to "add" (to the list of pronouns which are permitted) a thing (which indicates that VARIK exhibits $z$), e.g., "any assigned variable" or "any:variable"),
* that (the interface of PRONOUNS.PAGE. outputs "`Unrecognized format.  Please check out the instructions above.`"), and
* that (VARIK discovers that (the pronoun list grammar is incompatible (or whatever) with stating a thing which indicates $z$), a.k.a. "$f$").

VARIK dislikes $f$.

## Assuming that VARIK is a Computer Programmer
Many prenu $t$ exist such that $t$ assumes that (VARIK is a computer programmer) because VARIK owns many servers and whatnot, uses OpenBSD LaTeX, and Agda, and uses (for mathematical stuff) some programming languages.

Assuming that VARIK is a computer programmer annoys VARIK.  The proof of being annoyed is relevant to that (VARIK is a mathematician and is not a computer rogrammer)... and some thing $x$ such that VARIK is not certain about $x$.

But being annoyed by assuming is fucked.  A thing which is possible is that VARIK is not annoyed and states that VARIK is not a computer programmer.

## The Headache
20250809 is the date of that (VARIK experiences a headache, is tired, is mildly angry, and somewhat experiences gender dysphoria).  But VARIK is uncertain of the subject/target/whatever of the anger.

VARIK opines...

* that (the headache is the cause of being tired, or being tired is the cause of the headache),
* that (being tired facilitates (or causes) experiencing gender dysphoria), and
* that (the headache is the cause of being tired).

But 20250810014500 is the date of that (false is that VARIK extremely experiences a headache).
