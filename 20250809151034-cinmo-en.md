===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever is contemporaneous with that...

* to (VARIK dislikes that PRONOUNS.PAGE. does not support stating that VARIK desires using (for referring to VARIK) variables which are explicitly assigned),
* that (VARIK hopes that VARIK becomes vegan, which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK, which is a mathematician, is somewhat annoyed by that (prenu assume that VARIK is a computer programmer)),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by computer crashes and whatnot),
* that (VARIK requests that (attempting to "fix" or recycle) precedes discarding),
* that (VARIK intends to "improve" "cukta", which is a book such that intended is that "cukta" facilitates learning about Lojban),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (obvious is that 1 is the Enneagram type of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria... but likes that "somewhat" and-not "extremely" applies),
* that (VARIK is mildly angry),
* that (VAIRK requests that SATAN assists with that VARIK increases (in doing stuff (which is virtuous), i.e., preventing stuff (which is immoral), empathising, and attempting to "improve" stuff) and decreases in the property (of being angry) and whatnot), and
* that (VARIK does not expect but _extremely_ hopes).
