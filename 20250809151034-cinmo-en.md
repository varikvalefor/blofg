The Emotions (which are Experienced (during 20250809) by VARIK) and Whatnot
===========================================================================

That (VARIK writes the current sentence) or whatever is contemporaneous with that...

* to (VARIK dislikes that PRONOUNS.PAGE. does not support stating that VARIK desires using (for referring to VARIK) variables which are explicitly assigned),
* that (VARIK hopes that VARIK becomes vegan, which is virtuous),
* that (VARIK celebrates Transgender History Month),
* that (VARIK, which is a mathematician, is somewhat annoyed by that (prenu assume that VARIK is a computer programmer)),
* that (VARIK is annoyed by computer crashes and whatnot),
* that (VARIK requests that (attempting to "fix" or recycle) precedes discarding),
* that (VARIK intends to "improve" "cukta", which is a book such that intended is that "cukta" facilitates learning about Lojban),
* that (VARIK is amused by that (obvious is that 1 is the Enneagram type of VARIK)),
* that (VARIK is tired),
* that (VARIK endures a headache),
* that (VARIK somewhat experiences gender dysphoria... but likes that "somewhat" and-not "extremely" applies),
* that (VARIK is mildly angry),
* that (VARIK struggles to describe the emotions which are experienced by VARIK),
* that (VARIK believes that some thing $t$ esxists such that for all prenu $p$, if $p$ understands $t$, then explaining $p$ is impossible (or difficult) for $p$),
* that (VAIRK requests that SATAN assists with that VARIK increases (in doing stuff (which is virtuous), i.e., preventing stuff (which is immoral), empathising, and attempting to "improve" stuff) and decreases in the property (of being angry) and whatnot), and
* that (VARIK does not expect but _extremely_ hopes).

## Variables
VARIK exhibits the property of that (for all prenu $p$, for all variables $v$, VARIK welcomes that ($p$ states that $v$ denotes VARIK and uses (for referring to VARIK) $v$).  An example of variable pronoun use is "VARIK, a.k.a. '$z$', is $z$".

A sequence of events which happen is...

* that (VARIK begins creating a PRONOUNS.PAGE. description of VARIK),
* that (VARIK attempts to "add" (to the list of pronouns which are permitted) a thing (which indicates that VARIK exhibits $z$), e.g., "any assigned variable" or "any:variable"),
* that (the interface of PRONOUNS.PAGE. outputs "`Unrecognized format.  Please check out the instructions above.`"), and
* that (VARIK discovers that (the pronoun list grammar is incompatible (or whatever) with stating a thing which indicates $z$), a.k.a. "$f$").

VARIK dislikes $f$.

## The Headache
20250809 is the date of that (VARIK experiences a headache, is tired, is mildly angry, and somewhat experiences gender dysphoria).  But VARIK is uncertain of the subject/target/whatever of the anger.

VARIK opines...

* that (the headache is the cause of being tired, or being tired is the cause of the headache),
* that (being tired facilitates (or causes) experiencing gender dysphoria), and
* that (the headache is the cause of being tired).

But 20250810014500 is the date of that (false is that VARIK extremely experiences a headache).
