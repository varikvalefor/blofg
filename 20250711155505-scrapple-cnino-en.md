20250705 is the date of that VARIK begins defining Scrapple.  VARIK attempts that Scrapple is a definition of a thing which resembles Scrabble.

Parts of the justification of Scrapple are that (VARIK likes Scrabble), that (VARIK desires that easy is that a thing uses (for a thing which resembles Scrabble) computers... and does not use stuff which is proprietary), and that VARIK desires serialising Scrabble games.


VARIK welcomes suggesting "changing" Scrapple.

The URL of the stuff of Scrapple is "http://git.varikvalefor.i2p/vvx/scrapple".

VARIK translates (to English and from Lojban) the blog post.

## "What is Scrapple?"
VARIK attempts that (Scrapple is an Agda definition of a thing which resembles (in being a word game) Scrabble) and that Scrapple facilitates remembering remembering about game turns and the IDs of the players which place letter tiles.

## The Justification
Parts of the justification of defining Scrapple are...

* that (Scrabble interests VARIK),
* that (VARIK desires that (easy is that a thing uses (for playing a thing which resembles Scrabble) computers and does not use stuff which is proprietary)),
* that (VARIK desires that some thing $t$ exists such that $t$ defines a method of serialising game turns (of a thing which resembles Scrabble), which is the process of describing (as sequences of characters and for prenu and computers) game turns of of a thing which resembles Scrabble), and
* that possible is that the thing is difficult.

## Suggestions

Scrabble resembles many things which are created by VARIK.  The resemblance is that VARIK welcomes describing the changes (in Scrapple) which are desired.  Additionally, VARIK welcomes sending pull requests.  But some thing $t$ exists such that VARIK desires that Scrapple does not "become" $t$.
