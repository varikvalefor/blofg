# Sending Quote Replies
Many questions $t$ exist such that ($t$ is sent to VARIK and via a text thing, and the response (from VARIK) (regarding $t$) contains $t$ and an answer (for $t$).  A part of the justification of containing is that VARIK deisres that the questions which are answered by VARIK are not "changed".

## The Shape
Many questins (for VARIK or whatever) $t$ exist such that VARIK responds to $t$ and with the concatenation of...

* a thing (which indicates the nature of $t$) and
* an answer for $t$.

## The Justification
Parts of the justification of that (many answer messages which are created by VARIK indicate the questions which is answered), a.k.a. "$R$", are...

* that ($R$ is easy for VARIK),
* that (VARIK [OPPOSITE] {ADVERB} desires that (a question which is answered by VARIK is changed, and discovering that the question has been "changed" is not easy), a.k.a. "$N$"), and
* that ($P$ prevents $N$).
